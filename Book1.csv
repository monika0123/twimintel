What’s more important: knowing the sector or knowing the customer?
kakaobank is transforming banking in South Korea by creating customer-first experiences. 
In July 2017, a new mobile-only bank was launched in Korea. In the first 24 hours, it had attracted more than 300,000 subscribers. Within a fortnight, it surpassed two million customers, amassing ₩1 trillion (US$930m) in savings and providing ₩770 billion (US$701m) in loans. Today, it is well on the way to having 10 million customers, that in a country of just over 50 million people (economically active population is 25 million). This is the story of the staggering growth of kakaobank.
Formed by the company behind South Korea’s hugely popular Kakao Talk messaging app, the rapid rise of the new, separate kakaobank digital-first bank was the result of looking at banking in an entirely new light. By constantly asking: “what is the purpose of a banking business?” and by applying digital-first thinking, kakaobank is transforming banking services in South Korea — and driving innovation in the banking industry.
The purpose of a banking business
Examining the existing banking landscape, EY and the kakaobank preparation team — made up of a number of key shareholders — identified that there were many Koreans who were not using many banking products and services because they had not been designed in a customer-centric way, and were often very difficult to use.
And market research by the EY FSO Advisory team in Seoul found that price was a driver of Korean banking customers switching providers. Creating a significant cost differential was therefore another important consideration.
Traditional banks spend large sums on their operational costs. Some banks can see up to 60% of their outgoings spent on branch operations and back offices. The kakaobank team wanted to strip away these costs and then share the benefits with their customers. Indeed, a key part of bringing the Korean financial regulator on board to issue new digital bank licenses was to demonstrate the benefits that could be passed on to the public.
So important was running a lean business that the kakaobank team even ruled out creating an online banking service, seeing it as unnecessarily expensive. This decision was reflective of the EY and kakaobank approach throughout the development process.
“The kakaobank team was very good at asking difficult questions,” says Young-Suk Kim, EY Korea Digital Lead and EY APAC FSO PI Lead. “Throughout, they kept asking ‘why are we doing this? Why are we selling loans and other banking products? Do we want to make money?’ — all to maintain their focus on delivering a bank beyond a bank.”
The art of thinking differently.
Through a digital-first and cross-functional approach, EY and kakaobank are helping to prove a digital-first banking model in South Korea.
Starting with a blank sheet of paper, the kakaobank preparation team worked with EY to develop and implement a strategy to create and launch a different type of bank.
Building a new kind of bank is not merely about beating your rivals’ rates. It is about rethinking how people use banks in the 21st century.
“We see lots of challenger banks launching,” explains Jan Bellens, EY Global Banking & Capital Markets Sector Leader. Across the world, this phenomenon is being driven by industry convergence. Social media companies, e-commerce companies and gig economy companies are getting into financial services.”
“We looked at all types of digital banks around the world,” says Young-Suk Kim, Korea Digital Lead and APAC FSO PI Lead, EY. “But we wanted to take a new approach.”
For these users, everything is mobile and on-demand, available whenever and wherever. The EY and kakaobank teams channeled this mindset and transferred it to the banking world to develop a new banking app that borrowed the customer-centric characteristics of Kakao Talk to transform banking.
“We questioned every existing process, from transactions to money transfers, to foreign exchange,” explains Kim. “Could technology reduce the number of steps customers needed to take to open accounts or access finance? How can we make the process far more convenient and far more accessible?”
Whether your company does business with a multinational footprint or operates in a single country, tax and finance professionals are expected to navigate through largely uncharted territory while maintaining an enterprise-wide view across the tax life cycle.
The need to get it right first time
Creating a digital platform that could offer far greater convenience, however, would only become a reality if they could help the new bank meet all the necessary standards of compliance, resilience and security. “After proposing the initial concept, we started work on helping the regulator understand what we were trying to achieve,” says Bellens. “This helped secure a license to bank — and then we helped kakaobank through set-up: technology assessment, risk control, customer experience design and so on.”
The EY FSO Assurance and Advisory teams and kakaobank in Seoul worked closely with the EY Technology services in Hong Kong under James Lloyd, EY Asia-Pacific FinTech Leader; as well as with the Korean regulator to prove that you can leverage new technologies to actually improve know-your-customer (KYC) benchmarks.
“For instance,” says Bellens, “Traditionally, a customer would have to show up to a branch in person to open a bank account. But since 2016, Korea has accepted a selfie as part of an e-KYC initiative. This is then cross-referenced against a series of databases and criteria, and could be more secure than an in-person meeting at a bank.”
The trouble was that customers weren’t comfortable using selfies to open bank accounts and didn’t really see the benefits. EY worked with the kakaobank team to demonstrate that a different approach to e-KYC could create a much better customer experience. Using these new systems, prospective kakaobank customers can now open an account in 7 minutes, compared to the average 20-30 minutes at other banks.
The EY Assurance team also worked closely with colleagues in China, the UK and the US to better understand data privacy, cybersecurity and anti-money laundering requirements. Similarly, the EY Tax team made sure that kakaobank’s tax function would be able to address the twin demands of regulatory compliance and enabling sound reporting.
A banking business model for a digital age
“Like many of its emerging technology peers around the world, Kakao views its business from an activation first, monetization second perspective,” says Kim. For kakaobank, this created a challenge: there were differing opinions within the shareholder group on what the business model should be and when to monetize.
Bringing better banking to more people
Digital disruption is driving industry convergence and helping to meet customer demands, for kakaobank and beyond. 
The collaboration of EY and kakaobank has resulted in millions of customers having convenient access to a bank in the palm of their hands. A million people signed up in the first five days of the bank’s launch in July 2017, boosting Kakao’s share price by over 8% — and demand has continued to rise, with new services being prepared for roll-out to meet demand.
With the ability to manage their finances and get personal loans and international money transfers at low-interest rates and commission fees, it’s no surprise the success of kakaobank has prompted many other technology companies to look at creating their own financial services businesses. Digital disruption has blurred the lines across most industries and the banking sector is no exception.
“There has been a lot of inertia in banking,” says Bellens. “Traditional banks have benefited from the fact that, frankly, there were not a lot of better alternatives.” Emerging technology companies, from social media firms to e-commerce platforms, have seen the inertia in traditional banking and want to challenge the status quo.
These platform players and organizations with large customer bases often have very strong engagement. If these new players, who customers already trust, offer a convenient way to bank, or to do other things in a more convenient way, more traditional organizations are going to face an interesting question. Because trust is the way to acquire customers. And this threat is forcing banks to respond and reassess their existing value propositions.”
Bellens continues, “There's already quite a number of clients that have come to us, based on the kakaobank success, asking for us to help them build something similar. “We’ve helped and are helping several banks get better at digital.” Interest has extended beyond Southeast Asia to the Middle East and even to the bastion of traditional banking — Wall Street."
doc2,"South Korea FinTech Gets Initial Approval For Online Bank
Digital Banking
South Korean FinTech startup Viva Republica, creator of the financial services platform Toss, was granted preliminary approval for a digital banking license from the Financial Services Commission of Korea, a Monday (Dec. 16) press release indicated.
“Toss has already become the leading financial super app in Korea. With a digital bank license, we will be able to broaden our product offering … so that we can accelerate our mission to innovate the financial industry,” said SG Lee, CEO of Viva Republica.
Since its launch in 2015, Toss has become the only FinTech unicorn in Korea. The bank is expected to start operating during the first six months of 2021 after it gets the final nod for a license.
A digital banking license will enable Toss to offer an extensive menu of financial services to individuals and businesses. Calling itself a “challenger bank for the underbanked,” Toss will even offer banking products to people with thin files and mid-range credit scores.
Viva Republic, which was founded in 2013, first launched Toss as a peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfer service, Deal Street Asia reported. Toss Bank will become South Korea’s third digital bank operating without a physical location. In 2017, two internet-only banks – K Bank and Kakao Bank – officially launched.
Valued at $2.2 billion following August’s $64 million funding round, the Toss app has been downloaded more than 30 million times and has over 16 million registered users – over 20 percent of South Korea’s population.
Last year, Kakao Bank and K Bank reported net losses of 21.2 billion won ($18 million) and 79.7 billion won ($68 million) respectively, according to data from the Korea Federation of Banks, Deal Street Asia reported.
On Oct. 31, South Korea started a pilot-testing program for open banking. The South Korean government said it would run the pilot phase and then assess the system and its performance, making adjustments as necessary. The system will be released to FinTech firms by Wednesday (Dec. 18)."
doc3,"Korea’s digital banks have two speeds: fast and faster
Dark memories of the Asian financial crisis inform South Korea’s fear of chaos and wariness of financial technology, but the success of two online banks gives the country what it needs: fintech leaders it can respect and disruption it can embrace.
Few countries are as digitally advanced as South Korea. Asia’s fourth-largest economy embraced the internet early and fervently, and the love affair endured. It is regularly voted the world’s most innovative nation, thanks in large part to the presence and power of firms such as Samsung, a voracious issuer of new patents. The average internet speed in South Korea is 26.7 megabits per second, faster than anywhere else in the world, according to French virtual private network developer Le VPN. Connectivity is a way of life, whether it is senior citizens trading shares on their tablets or taxi drivers who accept any kind of plastic card and can swipe and print a receipt in seconds. But there is one realm of the digital world where South Korea is a follower not a leader. Put simply, when it comes to financial technology, South Korea is a laggard. Local lenders such as Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank and KEB Hana Bank have long offered perfectly good online banking services. But none is likely to set the world alight with their current offerings. Euromoney’s award for best global digital bank is usually a contest between DBS, Citi, ING and BBVA, because these banks invest heavily and consistently in digital, using internal disruption to find new ways to serve corporates and citizens. No Korean bank has ever been in the mix for this much-coveted prize. Nor did a single Korean firm appear in the latest Forbes rankings of the world’s 50 most innovative fintech companies. Indeed, it’s hard to identify a single well-known and home-grown fintech brand. There’s no Korean answer to, say, China’s Ant Financial, or Singapore-based ride-sharing-to-food-delivery service Grab. Disruption The causes and forces that explain South Korea’s plodding approach to financial technology are many and varied. For one thing, it has never been a primary political objective. “We are a highly IT-enabled country, but the government views finance as a supplementary industry, rather than as an industry that drives the economy,” says a senior banker working locally at an international lender. That’s fair enough, but an aversion to disruption, digital or otherwise, runs deep here, and for good reason. The Asian financial crisis of 1997/98 nearly broke one of the world’s most exciting emerging economies. Teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, the IMF swooped in with a $58 billion bailout package – at the time, the largest in its history. The swingeing austerity measures that the IMF imposed, designed to cut debt and prevent another crisis, shuttered banks and corporates. Korea bounced back of course and is considered a world leader in industries from cars to electronics, but this period of collective trauma is still referred to locally as the ‘IMF crisis’. Rather than suggesting invention and advance, ‘disruption’ became a dirty word. “Those events came to inform the culture of the financial regulator,” notes the senior international banker. “When there is financial disruption, there is the fear that it could lead to another crisis, so the banks are kept very tightly regulated.” Traditional banks in Korea don’t think about the customer. They only think about themselves [and] break-even points. We are always looking to add value, to give the customer something new - Suyoung Lee, kakaobank Others point to the deleterious actions of Korea’s powerful and strike-loving unions. Sanjeev Rana, a senior technology analyst in Korea at CLSA, says union power “made the financial authorities reluctant to foster innovation that could disrupt the way the traditional banks work. That is why South Korea has been left behind in fintech. “We are good in areas like IT and smartphones, but these are not new technologies.” The onward march of disruptive innovation could not be ignored for ever. Slowly but surely, Korea realized it had been left behind. Rana points to the shock of seeing a new generation of digital champions, from fintech insurer ZhongAn to micro-lender Qudian, emerge from the once-backward market on the other side of the Yellow Sea. “China used to be mocked when it came to technology and innovation,” Rana says. “Yet over time, Korean officials found they had to visit the mainland to find out what is going on in machine learning, artificial intelligence and blockchain. Finally, they saw that in order to survive, they had to financially innovate.” Transformation The cogs began to grind, slowly at first. In late 2015, the then-chair of the Financial Services Commission, Yim Jong-yong, granted preliminary approval for the creation of the country’s first two pure online banks. His successor, Choi Jong-Ku, predicted the pair would be lightning rods capable of “transforming conventional financial services”. And so it proved. K Bank was the first to open its doors in April 2017 with W250 billion ($223 million) in start-up capital. It was followed three months later by kakaobank, which began life with W300 billion in start-up capital. “We had 18 months to learn how to be a bank,” says Suyoung Lee, head of strategic operations at kakaobank: “It was a really crazy time.” Office space was rented in the heart of Seoul – just a stone’s throw from the Blue House, home to South Korea’s president – with a digital incubator operating from the central city of Seongnam. Yan Lee kakaobank_300 Yan Lee, kakaobank Despite being second off the grid, kakaobank quickly overtook its rival. A quarter of a million people opened an account within 24 hours of its launch. In its first week, it lent $232 million and took $245 million in deposits. By the end of September 2018, the financial newcomer had disbursed $7 billion in loans to 6.8 million customers, taking $8.4 billion in deposits. It is already one of Korea’s biggest issuers of debit cards, distributing 5.6 million of them by the end of September 2018. Its digital rival got off to a shakier start. K Bank did well on debut, opening 35,000 accounts on day one. But thereafter it was forced to watch as kakaobank raced by, and off into the distance. By the end of September 2018, the older bank had disbursed $1.18 billion in loans to 810,000 customers – or less than one eighth of kakaobank’s total – taking $1.72 billion in deposits. Even at this early stage, the newer bank’s finances look relatively healthier. It reported a net loss of $10.7 million in the first half of 2018, against a loss of $35.3 million over the same period for K Bank. At first glance, the two look remarkably similar. Both are backed by strong corporate and institutional names. In the case of kakaobank, the largest shareholder is Korea Investment Holdings, an investment management firm and Kospi index component, with a 58% stake. Other shareholders include local lender KB Kookmin Bank, eBay, China’s Tencent Holdings and Kakao, an internet group founded in 2014 by billionaire Kim Beom-soo. Despite being the new firm’s parent and operator, Kakao owns just 10%, due to Korea’s quirky rules that prevent non-financial firms from owning more than one 10th of a banking affiliate. K Bank’s tangle of investors include Woori Bank, Ant Financial, videogame developer Smilegate, steelmaker Posco and the national tourism federation. Its parent and operator – but again, not its chief shareholder – is KT Corporation, which owns 10%. And this fact is important. KT and Kakao may not own K Bank and kakaobank outright, but when casting around for a responsible strategic partner to control and supervise each upstart lender, the financial regulator chose well. Both overseers excel in the art of accumulating and then sifting through reams of personal data in search of indicators of a customer’s all-round creditworthiness. Through its parent company, kakaobank is affiliated to KakaoTalk, the country’s dominant messaging app, used by 82% of Korea’s 51 million people. And K Bank benefits from its ability to fall back on the thousands of terabytes of data carried daily by KT, the country’s largest telecommunications firm. But this is where the similarities end and the differences emerge, as the gap between the two lenders is now a chasm, and the question has become impossible to ignore: how has kakaobank been able to trounce its rival so thoroughly? Korea-digital-banks-financials-image-400 Most bankers and analysts seem at a loss when the question is posed. But dig a little, and points of deviation emerge. From the start, K Bank set out with the principal aim of being South Korea’s leading online lender. Even in its latest promotional material, and despite the scorching performance of kakaobank, its vision is clearly outlined: to be the number one mobile bank. By contrast, kakaobank branded itself as an auxiliary lender at the outset: a fall-back option for those curious about digital banking, but unsure whether or not to fully embrace it. “Most customers have a main bank, but we thought it would be very hard to convince them to make us their main bank,” says Lee, its head of strategic operations. “Our aim from the start was to be a second bank.” At first, the big hurdle to overcome was trust. “There are still many people in Korea who don’t trust internet banks,” Lee adds. “They are worried about security.” Only time could alter those perceptions, so kakaobank focused on developing services that distanced it from the crowd. “We knew when we started that we had to give our customers something special,” says Lee. “Traditional banks in Korea don’t think about the customer. They only think about themselves [and] break-even points. We are always looking to add value, to give the customer something new. If we provide a bad service, it will hurt our brand; so we made service our top priority.” Every company says this, of course, but the initial speed of evolution at kakaobank was impressive. Like K Bank, it started life offering services on cellphones and desktops, but when it saw that users favoured the former, it was quick to drop the latter. It was the first to provide cash-back services and to issue debit cards that could be used overseas – a big draw for younger customers. It claims its overseas wire transfer fees are one/10th the average rate charged by traditional banks. Of the two, kakaobank has also been better at tapping fresh sources of capital. Within two months of its launch, it raised W500 billion by issuing 100 million new shares to new and existing shareholders. In April 2018, it raised another W500 billion in a rights issue, boosting its paid-in capital to W1.3 trillion. KBank’s capital-raising plans have been less successful. It raised W100 billion from 13 of its founder-shareholders in September 2017, although seven early-stage investors declined to take part in the capital-raising, leaving W20 billion unclaimed. In May 2018, it set out to obtain another W150 billion by selling a mix of common and convertible preferred stock to shareholders, but raised just W30 billion. One analyst says the main source of discontent among shareholders was “K Bank’s poorer performance when compared to its only rival”. Shim Sung-hoon_400 Shim Sung-hoon, KBank But the older digital lender, he adds, has also been stymied by “its weight of shareholders. It has too many, and they already have a history of disagreeing over the bank’s best course of direction. This might make it hard ultimately for it to achieve its goals.” At the end of the first half of 2018, K Bank’s total paid-in capital was W350 billion. Sources close to K Bank admit that its rival has benefited from having “fewer stakeholders and a simpler governance structure”, a fact that enabled kakaobank “to raise huge capital much faster”. But perhaps the key weapon in kakaobank’s armoury – and the attribute that really sets it apart from its rival – is one that has little to do with banking and far more to do with our desire for connectivity and our longing to relate brands to emotions. This is where its sister app again comes into play. When kakaobank was launched, it was consciously marketed to young people who loved the colourful emoticons developed and popularised by KakaoTalk. The bank found that anyone who loved the bouncing, dancing cartoons was far more likely to open an account. It drew on that knowledge, allowing users to download the much-loved emoticons, which range from crooning penguins to gentle lions and piano-tinkling crocodiles. Customers loved being able to personalise their in-app services, or apply for a debit card adorned with an image of Neo, a sleek and suave urban cat, or the afro-toting secret agent Groovy Jay-G. Simple stuff, but reflective of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ tactic of figuring out what a customer is going to want before they ask for it. And in its own way, it has democratized finance by letting KakaoTalk users send money to one another via the messaging app, without needing to be a bank customer. It’s hard to overstate the importance of these jolly little emoticons. “Research shows us that 40% of new customers join kakaobank just to be able to use them,” says Kim Hyo-sub, head of financial institutions at Shinhan Bank. Lee, kakaobank’s strategy chief, downplays the findings. “That figure is true and it’s also not true,” he demurs, before adding that being allowed to use the emoticons was “very important” for its development. In June 2018, the bank rolled out a new video-based customer service chatbot that also works on KakaoTalk, and that aims to cut costs by resolving 80% of customer enquiries digitally. Even K Bank bows to the influence and power of kakaobank’s sister messaging app. For all its impressive initial success, kakaobank knows it is still at the start of a very long journey. It will surely be challenged and tested in the digital stakes by resurgent traditional lenders irked at having lost so much ground to a mere upstart. We will settle down in Korea first. But later, there are some very good, very big markets with a thriving Korean diaspora, many of whom use KakaoTalk and know about kakaobank - Daniel Yun, kakaobank Shinhan Bank’s Hyo-sub says the two online lenders have forced it to “focus more on digital banking. We are scared of losing all of our young customers who use their smartphones all day. Young people trust kakaobank.” K Bank is also unlikely to give up on its dream of being the digital number one. Unlike its rival, it declined to sit down and talk on the record with Asiamoney. But in November 2018, its chief executive Shim Sung-hoon promised that the bank would shed its conservative image, once a revised law governing digital banks comes into effect in January 2019. If approved, the rule change will allow KT to boost its stake in K Bank to 34%, from 10%. “The revised law is about to breathe life into the bank,” Shim said in a public statement, adding that after becoming K Bank’s biggest shareholder, KT would boost the bank’s paid-in capital to more than W1 trillion. Sources close to the digital bank, which employs 300 staff, say that a fresh injection of capital from KT and other big shareholders in the new year would enable K Bank to launch more innovative and productive services. The financial regulator also plans to issue banking licences to at least two new purely digital lenders, although neither is likely to open for business before 2021. By then, if events go to plan, kakaobank will have completed its initial public offering – and could even be included in the Kospi index – with K Bank expected to follow suit. Also on kakaobank’s agenda is expansion into new markets. Daniel Yun kakaobank_300 Daniel Yun, kakaobank “We definitely want to go overseas,” says Lee, a message that is regularly reinforced by the bank’s co-chief executive Daniel Yun. “We will settle down in Korea first,” Yun says. “But later, there are some very good, very big markets with a thriving Korean diaspora, many of whom use KakaoTalk and know about kakaobank.” While Yun didn’t name those markets, the largest Korean diaspora are in China, the US and Japan. K Bank’s chief executive, Sung-hoon, has also targeted several markets for expansion, including Indonesia and Vietnam – where it is eyeing a partnership with BC Card, Korea’s leading payment processing company, whose largest shareholder is KT – as well as Japan. The telecoms firm sees K Bank as an ideal conduit through which to export its financial technology. In August 2018, K Bank signed a five-year
 $5 million deal to provide internet banking technology and a credit-scoring system to Mongolia’s MCS Group, which has applied to set up a digital bank in its home market. All of which means kakaobank cannot rest on its laurels. It is still adding customers at a furious rate, while introducing new services and products, including term deposits and unsecured loans for prime and sub-prime customers. Even though it already thinks and acts like a high-functioning and well-run lender, kakaobank is keen to retain its underdog status, allowing it to continue to hide in plain sight for as long as possible. “We are still weak and small,” strategy head Lee insists, despite ample evidence to the contrary. “The traditional banks are Goliath; we are David. We need to avoid competition and focus on areas where we are strong and where the traditional banks are weak.” Looking back, the reticence felt by the financial regulator when allocating new digital licences was perfectly understandable. This is a thrillingly vibrant economy with a tendency to fervently embrace any new idea or concept, as long as it guarantees customers the divine troika of entertainment, connectivity and convenience. It was all but inevitable that both new financial institutions would prove popular, although few could have foreseen the speed of kakaobank’s ascendancy. Even Lee looks a touch surprised at the bank’s speedy success. “I was the fifth person to join,” he says. “Now we have 500 people and counting. When this project started in 2015, our traditional lenders knew that digital banking was the way forward, but they didn’t know how fast the future would arrive. “The pace of change over the past five years has been so rapid, but the next five will be faster still.”"

ROAA is still relatively low at -0.9% in December 2018.
This chart from Moody’s shows that Korea’s virtual banks are having trouble turning a profit as return on average assets (ROAA) stands at a relatively low at -0.9% in December 2018. The latest figure, however, marks an improvement from -7.2% in December 2017.

“Virtual banks' profitability will be low, reflecting a strategic use of competitive pricing to gain market share in a modestly growing banking market. This strategy was exaggerated in the past 18 months with heavy promotions, as the two new banks offered lower lending rates and higher deposit rates,” Moody’s said in a report.
In 2017, K Bank and Kakao Bank posted net losses of $74m (KRW84b) and $92m (KRW104.49b), respectively, data from Korea Federation of Banks (KFB) show.
Despite the repercussions, Moody’s believe that the virtual lenders are likely to push through with their aggressive pricing strategy until a meaningful scale is reached.
“External capital access will be a key driver of virtual banks' potential growth because profit and therefore internal capital generation, will remain low in the coming years,” Moody’s continued.
Kakao Bank and K Bank have only managed to capture just 0.6% of the KRW-denominated loans market as of end 2018. Both lenders have been the most active in the unsecured personal loan market with plans to extend to retail loan segments like mortgages."

Virtual banking changes what we traditionally think of as a bank.
Virtual banking changes what we traditionally think of as a bank. Talking points Virtual banking The creation of virtual banks in Singapore is driving fundamental reshaping of the banking ecosystem. New trend in banking Virtual banks have already been established in the US, UK, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Stringent requirements Addressing regulatory, compliance, and security requirements are key to the success of new virtual banks. Potential disruption in banking The recent announcement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to grant five virtual banking licenses will inevitably have a disruptive effect on the local financial services industry.1 Two of the new licenses will be for the full range of retail banking services, which means that, for the first time in Singapore, non-banks will be able to accept deposits from and provide financial services to retail customers. The remaining three licenses are intended for wholesale banking. Virtual banking—and the innovation, inclusion, and customer choice it brings—is becoming prominent around the world. Hong Kong, South Korea, the United States, and United Kingdom have already opened the door to virtual banking. And some major Singapore banks are also gaining virtual banking experience, with DBS’ digibank in India, and UOB’s TMRW in Thailand. Who are the new entrants? Virtual banking changes what we traditionally think of as a bank. And new virtual banks in Singapore might diverge in their origin. They might be foreign banks looking for a way to break into the Singapore market without the expense of building branch offices. Or they might be payment companies, insurers, or fund houses seeking to expand the range of financial services they offer. There also could be interest from giant international digital retailers or telecommunications companies. But whatever their origin, entry of non-banking players has the potential to accelerate current momentum to integrate banking and non-banking supply chains and ecosystems.
Digital versus virtual Most major banks around the world have gone digital to some degree. From simply checking a balance to getting cash at an ATM to managing complex payments, consumers have grown accustomed to choosing between going to the local branch or banking on their home phone, cell phone, or computer. But virtual banks are a newer, more disruptive form of banking. Virtual banks differ from other forms of digital banking in that they only exist online. They have no branch offices within a community or a country. Consumers expect virtual banks’ savings in facilities and staff to directly translate to receiving higher interest rates on savings and paying lower rates on loans. However, some consumers might miss the emotional comfort of visiting a local branch office, renting a safety deposit box, seeking a banker’s advice, or working with residents who support the local economy and local events.  The impact of virtual banks Virtual banks could pose a significant threat to the three largest Singaporean banks. New licensees are likely to be backed by benefactors with deep pockets. They will likely have significant “beyond-banking” strategies that might be hugely disruptive. As an example, consider what is already happening in cross-border remittances. Monzo, a UK-based virtual bank, offers users international payments without additional fees or charges. And the bank does not charge extra fees for customers to withdraw up to GBP 200 per month from international ATMs.2 New entrants are likely to come in unpredictable ways. To increase competitive advantage, incumbent banks will need to leverage their customer bases, resources, and reputations more than ever. They will also need to sharpen their value propositions and, with the power of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled hyper-personalization, become even more customer-centric. For example, AI, which is rapidly moving from experimentation to scale, can augment banks’ ability to measure customer satisfaction and anticipate which clients are most likely to leave for a better offer. AI can help determine specific types of offers or “next best actions” that might help induce clients to remain loyal— or just remain. Lessons from beyond Impacts of virtual banking in other countries has been varied. In the US, the two leading virtual banks offer credit cards, loans, and personal savings accounts. They already hold billions of dollars in assets.3 In the UK, virtual banks, which must follow the same rules as retail banks, started offering small business loans and savings two years ago.4 South Korea’s two virtual banks, which fit well into the country’s low-cash-use economy, lost a combined USD 78 million in 2018.5 However, it’s too early to tell if that is simply the cost of getting started. One of these banks gained 300,000 customers in a 24-hour period when it started up in mid-2017—impressive growth by any measure.6 2
One study shows the average cost of a banking security breach is USD 3.86 million. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued licenses to eight virtual banks, which are expected to begin operation within the next six-to-nine months.7 Major Hong Kong banks are already responding by waiving or reducing loan and account fees, generating immediate customer benefits. It’s likely that Singapore will follow a similar—although not identical—model. For example, Singapore seems to be creating a strong business environment for virtual banks, but unlike some other regions, such as the UK, is not explicitly encouraging them. Key considerations for new entrants Given that Singapore is a small and saturated banking market, new virtual entrants will try to take market share with innovative propositions, such as the ability to get a single view of finances across multiple banks. (See case study, “Orange Bank.”) As with any bank or banking entity, the ability to address stringent regulatory, compliance, and security requirements is key to the success of new entrants. Indeed, regulation and security are perhaps the most important considerations in the development of virtual banks. Regulators must navigate a narrow route.  They must avoid causing a loss of confidence as a result of perceived lax controls. At the same time, they must not impose a wall of restrictive compliance and regulatory standards on new entrants. The goal is to maintain financial stability by encouraging rapid innovation in banking. Security is also a fundamental requirement for virtual banking. One study shows the average cost of a banking security breach is USD 3.86 million.8 Regulators and the public-at-large will not tolerate lax security among virtual banks. Accordingly, MAS has released frameworks with detailed requirements for companies applying for either retail or wholesale bank licenses.9 Case study: Orange Bank Since late 2017, Orange, a leading French telecom operator, has been operating a disruptive banking model in France with Orange Bank, reaching about 100,000 customers.10 Orange Bank’s innovative service, called Djingo, is a virtual advisor that allows customers to interact with their bank when and where they want. In France, mobile banking is becoming pervasive. Sixty-three percent of bank customers downloaded their bank’s app, and 47 percent use it at least weekly.11 And Djingo can answer questions in natural language and perform actions such as blocking or unblocking a credit card. Djingo was designed to serve as the first point of contact with Orange Bank. About one-in-five interactions with Djingo are outside normal working hours. And when contact with a professional banker is sought or required, Djingo smoothly transfers the conversation to an expert, along with all the pertinent details already covered. 3
Cognitive Enterprise Imagine the Cognitive Enterprise as composed of multiple business platforms. One or more of these acts as the core or primary platform(s), providing key differentiation. Organizations use and access secondary or supporting platforms as well. For example, middle- and back-office processes and underlying technology suites may be used to partner with other industry players or third parties. The business platform, then, is made up of capability layers. Each is subject to major transformation, and the potential that we envision for companies and organizations is huge. We think that incumbents will—as we are increasingly seeing—strike back if they can orchestrate change at scale.12 Making virtual a reality It may be that your non-bank enterprise is already considering a new foray into the world of banking. Or perhaps you are with a financial institution that needs to come to grips with new virtual banking competition. In either case, you can take steps to position for success in the race between new entrants exploiting their speed and flexibility and incumbents driving new value from relationships and data. For potential new entrants: – Clearly define a disruptive value proposition that will enable you to grab market share in a highly saturated banking marketplace. A new value proposition may call for forging new partnerships, supply chains, and ecosystems. – Build, acquire, or lease the right banking technology platform. The technology decisions you make today will have long range implications. A lightweight cloud-based core system, built on a modern technology stack that can use exponential technologies, such as AI, IoT and blockchain, is an ideal choice. – Address regulatory, compliance, and security considerations in your own operations and demand the same across your new banking ecosystem. 4
Incumbents will—as we are increasingly seeing—strike back if they can orchestrate change at scale. For incumbent banks –   Deepen customer engagement and sharpen value propositions. Your customer data can be a competitive weapon. Leverage the power of existing relationships and data to create highly personalized customer experiences that will be challenging for new entrants  to match. –   Deploy AI to augment your organization’s ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer expectations.  –   Become a Cognitive Enterprise by: –    Offering clients extreme convenience –    Extending your portfolio beyond traditional banking –    Deploying new technologies to radically lower your cost to serve clients –    Offering world-class security. Once trust is lost, reestablishing it is very expensive (see sidebar, “Cognitive Enterprise”). Key questions to consider –   What plans do you have in place if a new banking model challenges your customers’ loyalty? –   Whether you work for a traditional or  a virtual bank, what value proposition have you established to help you succeed against new competition? –   Where does your organization stand against the competition on deploying enabling technologies, such as AI,  IoT, and cloud?"

Special report

May 2nd 2019

YU, A 25-YEAR-OLD student in Seoul, racks his brain to answer a simple question: where do you bank? At three different institutions, it turns out, with six active accounts. One bank was nominated by a grant-giving body for the payment of a scholarship, another offered perks while he was doing military service and a third was where a previous employer insisted his salary be paid. He has several other dormant accounts, and “too many cards to remember”. One of them he applied for merely to get a bonus. “A saleswoman came into my office and said that if I spent 300,000 won [$300] on it, I’d get 100,000 won back.” He used it just once.

In South Korea, this profusion is perfectly normal. The average adult has 5.2 bank accounts and 3.6 credit cards. Financial products are chosen not because they are a good fit, or because an institution offers fine service, but almost entirely because of personal connections. Credit cards are peddled to acquaintances by freelance agents who split their commission. Flaws in customer acquisition mean that banking in South Korea has long been a miserable experience. Mobile-banking apps are poor or non-existent. Making a payment online typically requires 40 clicks and four passwords. But the past couple of years have seen a flurry of digital entrants. Some seek to help South Koreans cope with the existing muddle; others aim to replace it with something better.
In 2015 the Financial Services Commission (FSC), South Korea’s national regulator, decided that encouraging fintechs would shake up the incumbents and improve customer service, says Suh Jeong-ho of the Institute of Finance, a think-tank associated with the FSC. One of the most ambitious newcomers is Viva Republica. In December the startup became South Korea’s first fintech unicorn, raising $80m in a funding round that valued it at $1.2bn.

Founded in 2013 by Lee Seung-gun, a former dentist, Viva Republica tried several other ventures before going into digital payments with Toss (the name is supposed to suggest an easy shot in a ballgame), which has since grown into a comprehensive money-management app. Users can aggregate accounts, cards and loans into a single view, with outgoings classified by category. They can sign up for financial products, with Toss earning a commission. “If you’re looking for convenience, you have to use Toss,” says Yu, the overbanked student. “I can see how much I’ve spent and even invest in foreign stocks and peer-to-peer funding.”

The upstart’s speedy growth testifies to the awfulness of the traditional banking experience. Toss has 11m registered users, a quarter of the South Korean population. But its ambitions go much further. It is applying for a licence to set up a digital bank. The aim, declares Mr Lee, is to be the dominant South Korean “super-app” for all things financial. Banks do not see Toss as a threat, he says, but as a partner that cuts the cost of acquiring customers. In the long term, though, banks may lose out, he thinks. “We will get the [customer] engagement and they will become suppliers.”

Bank Salad (banking, but healthy), from Rainist, a fintech founded in 2012, is taking a narrower approach. It has 4m users and also offers account aggregation and money management, though not payments or transfers. Its chief executive, Kim Tae-Hoon, says it aspires to be a financial-adviser version of Jarvis, the AI assistant in the superhero film “Iron Man”.

Rainist’s strength is its data-driven referral system, which suggests products based on users’ spending patterns. According to its research, credit-card customers whom its partner institutions have acquired by other routes, such as agents who offer signing bonuses, spend an average of 600,000 won a month and stay for four months. The customers who sign up through Bank Salad spend three times as much each month and last nearly three times as long, so the card-issuers get a bargain for the commission they pay.
Salad, tossed

Both apps are shaking up South Korean banking by rationalising customer acquisition, setting new expectations for quality of service and, if Toss succeeds in becoming a bank, competing head-on. But there is another formidable challenger. Fully 94% of South Koreans use Kakao Talk, the chat app of Kakao, a social-media and mobile-gaming giant. Like WeChat, it includes a payment function, Kakao Pay, which has 28m registered users. It was used for more than 20trn won ($17.5bn) of payments in 2018.

A dominant social-media player’s success in payments is of obvious interest to other fintechs. In February 2017 Ant bought nearly 40% of the fledgling Kakao Pay for $200m. For Kakao Pay, says Shin Won-keun, its chief strategy officer, the appeal of Ant as a partner was that its portfolio is similar to what Kakao Pay would like to do. For Ant, it is a chance to learn from Kakao Talk: “They wanted to see what would happen with a messenger app.”

Kakao is now making a full-frontal assault on South Korea’s incumbent banks. In 2017 a consortium including Kakao Corporation, the brand’s parent company, won one of the country’s first two licences to run a digital bank. Kakao Bank has been a runaway success: within 13 days 2m people had signed up for current accounts and it now has 8.9m clients (K-Bank, the other newcomer, lags far behind with 1m). The FSC is considering allowing non-financial firms to hold larger stakes in banks (Kakao Corporation owns just 10% of Kakao Bank, the maximum permissible) and granting two more digital licences. Toss hopes to win one of them.

Rather than present itself as solid and respectable, as banks usually do, Kakao Bank comes over as playful and fun. Its debit cards, and those of Kakao Pay, feature the Kakao Friends, eight kooky characters created as emoji for Kakao Talk. Muzi, for example, is an optimistic piece of danmuji (pickled yellow radish) who dresses as a rabbit; the most popular character, Ryan, is a gentle lion who refused the throne of Doong Doong island and is self-conscious about lacking a mane.

Whether South Koreans will shift to running their financial lives through their Kakao accounts is another question. After all, when you already have five accounts, adding a sixth may not be that big a deal. But the hordes who have signed up demonstrate that customer expectations are changing. Instead of picking a stolid, sober bank manager to keep watch over their money, they are choosing a brand fronted by a gentle, maneless lion."

Highlights

Virtual banking is intensifying the competitive dynamics affecting Asia-Pacific banking.

Newly licensed indigenous virtual banks, global virtual-only banks, and digitized traditional banks are driving competition.

In the long term, virtual banking will likely contribute to the potential for increasing ratings differentiation between banking systems and banks across Asia-Pacific.

Jul. 17 2019 — Virtual banking is fanning the competitive flames in Asia-Pacific banking. Newly licensed indigenous digital banks, global digital-only banks, and digitized traditional banks are all vying for their share across the region's lucrative markets. To date, this development has not caused any noteworthy changes to our outlooks for banking sector country risks across the region. Our current base case is that virtual banking may not lead to rating or outlook changes for Asia-Pacific banks over the next two years. Over a longer time horizon, however, as virtual banking strategies take hold and further disrupt the traditional bank sector, the potential for ratings differentiation is greater.

New indigenous entrants in many Asia-Pacific countries--including in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Korea, and India--have either already begun operations or are expected to become functional in the next year or so. As more bank regulators across the region develop the infrastructure to manage and supervise virtual banks we expect this trend will continue. In addition, ex-regional players are expanding in Asia-Pacific, such as London-based Revolut Ltd., which is now operating in the region. Further, and perhaps most profoundly, traditional banks are accelerating electronic and digital banking strategies in the race for digital supremacy and a competitive edge.

Two key factors are driving the growth of digital banking in Asia-Pacific:

    Serving the underbanked: Primarily a factor in emerging markets, virtual banking facilitates the introduction of simple banking products through accessible means other than branches.
    Serving the overbanked: Primarily a driver in developed markets, virtual banking mainly seeks to provide customers with greater banking convenience at a lower cost.

What Is A Virtual Bank?

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) defines a virtual bank as a bank that primarily delivers retail banking services through the internet or other forms of electronic channels instead of physical branches.

We see the term ""virtual"" bank as often associated with or used interchangeably with other terms including ""digital"" bank, ""digital-only"" bank or ""challenger"" bank. The key characteristic of a virtual bank is the central use of technology to deliver banking services.
Emerging Markets: A Playing Field of Opportunities

Governments in emerging markets globally are driven by the allure of the financial inclusion agenda that virtual banks can offer. Emerging market nations in Asia-Pacific are home to vast numbers of ""underbanked"" consumers (see chart 1), which provides opportunities for virtual banks to gain a foothold and scale up their business models.

Further facilitating the foothold of virtual banks is the sheer size of underbanked populations across Asia-Pacific. China and India alone account for over 47% of the world's population, with a combined population of about 2.8 billion people. Furthermore, of the eight most populous countries globally, a further three are in Asia-Pacific--Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh--and all are significantly underbanked.

Current and future trends impacting demographics, urbanization, and customer behavior across Asia-Pacific are supportive of virtual banking. A young demographic pool, greater openness toward adopting new and innovative technologies in banking services--especially in China--and increasing consumerism provide tailwinds for the success of virtual banks.

Developed Markets: FOMO Mindset

The appeal of virtual banking in developed markets tends to have a different complexion. From a government standpoint, there is an interest in providing customers with cheaper, more competitive basic banking services in markets that small numbers of large and well-established traditional banks typically dominate. It is against this backdrop that virtual banks have a role. There is an increasing focus by traditional banks themselves--perhaps driven by a ""fear of missing out"" mindset--to execute skillfully on virtual banking strategies to gain efficiencies and improve profitability, and at the same time stay competitive and relevant in a rapidly transforming digital environment. As for emerging markets, some demographic factors-–such as younger consumers being more open to innovative technologies--may contribute to the increasing popularity of digital banks in developed markets.
Technological Improvements Provide Impetus

Ongoing technological improvements are a key enabler for the success of digital banks. We expect added stimulus from increasing mobile penetration and migration to faster internet speeds to make the environment more conducive for digital-only banks. According to GSMA Intelligence 2019, Asia-Pacific's smartphone adoption is set to increase to 82% in 2025, compared with 54% in 2018. In addition, the speed of about 95% of internet connections will be above 2G by 2025 (45% in 2018) (see charts 2 and 3).
Asia-Pacific Regulatory Landscape Is In Transition

We are seeing significant variability by country in the evolution of the regulatory landscape for virtual banks in Asia-Pacific. To what extent banking regulators across the region encourage innovative competition but at the same time balance the need to provide protective regulation for traditional banks and bank customers will shape the environment for the development of virtual banks.

Hong Kong:  The HKMA has granted eight virtual banking licenses in Hong Kong between March and May 2019 as part one of its smart banking initiatives. The diverse background of the licensees, which include traditional banks, insurance companies, fintech, as well as technology companies, is likely to facilitate financial innovation in the banking industry. We expect the virtual banks to carve out a niche market in the Greater Bay Area of Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong that could spur growth in the industry. In our opinion, the increased competition in the retail segment will eventually benefit customers and small and micro enterprises, and promote financial inclusion (see ""The Future Of Banking: Hong Kong's First Virtual Bank Licenses Will Rejuvenate The Banking Sector,"" published on March 29, 2019).

China:  WeBank is the first internet bank to operate in China and was granted its private bank license by China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) in 2014 as part of CBIRC's effort to promote innovation and introduce private capital to the banking industry. China's internet banks are mainly represented by four banks that are associated with the big techs: Webank (Tencent), Mybank (Alibaba), XWBank (Xiaomi), and aiBank (Baidu). Big Tech firms have hoarded a substantial amount of data from their social network, e-commerce, e-payment, and search engine businesses, which enables them to perform algo-lending with their own credit scoring mechanisms. These online competitors currently account for a minimal portion of the banking system which is partly due to their asset-light strategy. That is, these banks tend to use their fintech capabilities and big data to serve the consumer and small and midsize enterprise (SME) sector to acquire customers, then to co-lend with traditional banks for a fee.

Taiwan:  In Taiwan, the regulator is set to grant the first virtual bank licenses by end of July 2019 and this should allow the first virtual banks to launch banking services by the end of 2020. The upcoming virtual banks will be subject to the same regulatory compliances and risk management requirements as ordinary commercial banks, though they will be much smaller in scale in comparison. Therefore, we expect the initial setup costs and lack of scale economies could constrain profitability for virtual banks in their early stage of development amid the market's competitive and highly price-sensitive characteristics.

Singapore:  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recently announced plans to issue up to five new digital bank licenses, as part of a push to liberalize the city state's banking sector. There is potential for increased competition. Digital banks would likely compete actively with traditional banks in the mass retail space and SME space, and offer basic products that do not require face-to-face customer interaction. The regulator is managing undue disruption by requiring digital bank applicants to focus on underserved segments and provide clear value propositions on how they can complement the existing ecosystem. The rollout of the digital bank licenses indicate a measured approach on the regulator's part. For example, the full digital bank licenses will be implemented in stages and come with restrictions on product offerings and deposit taking. These will slowly be relaxed only when the digital bank has proven that it can manage the risks involved, and if it is delivering on its value proposition (see ""Singapore Follows A Measured Approach To Virtual Banking ,"" published on July 3, 2019).

S&SEA ex-Singapore:  Elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia (S&SEA), regulatory developments are at an earlier stage. We believe that a virtual banking framework in Malaysia will eventually be announced; and that the recent announcement by MAS may have a catalytic effect in Malaysia and elsewhere across S&SEA.

India:  With one of the world's largest fintech markets, India has a large ecosystem of traditional banks as well as startups and partnerships that are investing heavily in digital banking. These could help provide workable solutions to the problems facing traditional financial institutions in India such as low penetration, scarce credit history, and a cash-driven transaction economy. Further, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has shared draft regulations for a regulatory sandbox, which aims to provide live testing on digital products and services.

India does not allow any virtual banking licenses, though banks like DBS Bank Ltd. offer a digital-only product offering through their Indian subsidiaries. The RBI continues to place emphasis on physical networks and recently ensured that purely digital loan companies operating through mobile apps have at least one physical presence for customers to reach out to. The RBI had also highlighted earlier in its 2014 Guidelines for Licensing of ""Payments Banks"" that it does not envisage payment banks to be ""virtual"" or branchless banks.

Japan:  Japan has seen no major developments on the regulatory front. However, a recent joint venture between LINE, a social media company, and Mizuho FG, one the largest Japanese banking groups, suggests some movement in the virtual space. Since the parents of ""LINE Bank"" already have a broad customer base, there are many who expect a certain level of success. However, the example of the failure of U.S. Toys ""R"" Us, which had invested in new digital channels as well as traditional stores, suggests it will not be without its challenges.

Korea:  We expect the financial regulators to remain supportive of developing virtual banking and potentially allow new qualified entrants into the market. The special act on the establishment and operation of online-only banks took effect on Jan. 17, 2019, which allows for nonfinancial companies focusing on information and communication technology businesses to own up to 34% stakes in online-only banks (previously 10%). We believe the traditional banks will continue strengthening their established digital platforms against growing online-only banks though the market share of the two online-only banks is fairly small.

Australia:  In Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has not issued industry specific guidance on digital banks. APRA has, however, established a new pathway--a restricted deposit taking institution licensing framework--to assist small firms with limited financial resources. Some digital banks in Australia have already made use of this avenue, such as Xinja Bank Ltd., and our expectation is that other digital banks will explore this option in the future. In addition, APRA is cautiously supportive of cloud-based computing services, which will also assist digital banks. The regulator acknowledges the benefits of such services but has cautioned banks that it will not tolerate compromise in risk management practices in the pursuit of technology enabled cost savings.
Four Facets Of Disruption

To evaluate the risk of tech disruption in each individual banking sector, we assess the current state of technology, regulation, industry, and preferences (see chart 4), in what we call our TRIP analysis (see ""The Future Of Banking: Will Retail Banks Trip Over Tech Disruption ,"" published on May 14, 2019). The objective of the TRIP analysis is to explain how we expect the banking industry of each jurisdiction to evolve. For an example of an assessment of how technology disruption forms part of our analysis of the Chinese banking sector, see ""Tech Disruption In Retail Banking: China's Banks Are Playing Catch-Up To Big Tech,"" published on May 14, 2019.

Virtual banking is one of numerous technologies disrupting traditional retail banks. Hence an assessment of virtual banking is one risk factor among many that we take into account in an overall assessment of the risks of tech disruption as it affects a country's banking industry. The four facets of tech disruption for retail banks are as relevant for our analysis of virtual banking as they are for other tech disruption risks.
New Competitors Spice Up The Banking Landscape

Although at a nascent stage of development, individual new virtual banks compete head-to-head with traditional banks. This may have only an incremental competitive impact on the banking landscape in the short term although a more meaningful impact in the long term.

We believe that traditional banks with large well-established client bases and greater resources are better prepared to take on the potential competition from virtual banks as compared with the smaller and midsize banks. We expect smaller banks to rely on collaboration with tech companies to rise up the digital learning curve.

While it is early days for the evolution of virtual banking, trends to date in Asia-Pacific have tended to be more about payments than lending. That said, Big Tech in China has developed algo-lending capabilities that include inbuilt credit scoring systems. We anticipate the scope of virtual banking products, services, and business models will progressively widen as the industry evolves.
Partnering In Various Shapes And Sizes

Some traditional banks corral digitization strategies under the same brand as the principal operating bank and alongside traditional banking strategies including those for bricks-and-mortar banking. Other traditional banks in Asia-Pacific are partnering in various ways including by debuting in new geographies with digital-only arms.

Examples include:

    United Overseas Bank Ltd.'s tapping of the Thai market by launching ASEAN's first mobile-only bank in Thailand.
    CIMB Bank Bhd.'s entry in the Philippines, joining hands with about 8,000 convenience stores and launching an all-digital and mobile-first bank app.
    China CITIC Bank's joint venture with search giant Baidu, which has led to the creation of aiBank. aiBank's mission is to apply big data and artificial intelligence to cater to China's massive online finance market.
    Passive investments in digital-only banks, such as India-based Kotak Mahindra Bank's holding of an about 20% stake in the Airtel Payments Bank, and State Bank of India's 30% stake in Jio Payments Bank.
    In Australia, virtual bank Up has collaborated with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd. (Bendigo), with Bendigo meeting Up's regulatory capital and banking license requirements.

Profitability Will Be A Tough Nut To Crack

While operating costs for a digital-only bank are in principle lower, the long-term sustainable profitability of the digital-only banking model is only likely to be achievable commensurate with increasing scale and if ongoing risk and other business considerations are well-managed.

The journey to profitability for virtual banks is not without challenges, with digital-only banks facing high standards as they must adhere to strict licensing requirements including for capital, and prudential and risk management requirements. Risk management and compliance functions must keep pace with a range of operational risks--such as anti-money laundering controls--as well as business, credit, market, and technology risks. This is a challenge for new entrants that are growing quickly.

Furthermore, new virtual banks are concentrated in simple and limited products to targeted segments and niches. Digital banks' ability to diversify and expand product offerings over the long term is likely to offer possibilities for enhanced and more stable revenues.

Despite these challenges, there are now reports in the Asia-Pacific region of digital banks turning a profit. An example is South Korea's Kakao Bank, which was jointly launched by the country's most popular chat app operator and one of the major securities companies as major shareholders, has attracted about 9 million customers as of March 2019. Kakao reportedly turned a profit for the first time in the first quarter of 2019 only 18 months after its launch.
Regulatory Encouragement

Across Asia-Pacific, many regulators are showing various levels of encouragement toward the establishment of virtual banks. In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission has allowed new online-only banks a two- to three-year grace period to implement Basel III regulations (see table 1). These banks have been allowed to operate under Basel I regulations until 2022, unlike traditional banks, which must meet Basel III standards.

Meanwhile in Australia some of the newly established digital banks have been opting for restricted licenses (such as Archa and Xinja) while others have been applying for full licenses (86400, Volt, and Judo Bank). The restricted licensing option seems to be appealing for entities that are on the pathway to achieving a full banking license but are not there yet in terms of capabilities and resources.

In Hong Kong, however, the banking ordinance stipulates capital requirements for online-only banks to have a minimum share capital of HK$300 million. This is the same capital requirement that is required by traditional commercial banks.
Future State--Will Banks Need Branches?

While most traditional banks in Asia-Pacific are scrambling to digitize and trim their physical footprints, we believe that branches will continue to play their part. The rate of change impacting branch networks varies quite markedly, however, by country and by bank; and in some cases is quite dramatic. For example, in Thailand, Siam Commercial Bank Public Co. Ltd. has set aggressive targets to significantly rationalize its branch and employee count to drive its transformation toward a digital strategy. In South Korea, Citibank Korea Inc. made significant cuts to branch networks in 2017, focusing more on its digital strategy.

Traditional banks tend to carry the weight of legacy infrastructure and systems, including a significant portion of operations conducted through brick-and-mortar branches. They are challenged to diversify away from their physical infrastructure and digitize their operations in a comprehensive, all-embracing manner including front-end as well back-end operations. By contrast, virtual banks are nimble and carry no legacy baggage. They tend to be fully digital from inception from front-end customer interface through to back-office operations.

To further assist traditional banks to improve competitiveness, branch outlets of traditional banks are benefiting from a major makeover to incorporate digital-friendly technologies and customer-friendly environments. In our view, the trend toward smaller numbers of more digitally-advanced physical branch outlets will inevitably increase.

"
doc9,"Asia boasts one of the world’s most active financial technology (fintech) sectors, as technology conglomerates take advantage of increasing internet connectivity to provide digital financial services like online lending and mobile payments. Branchless, virtual banks have been in existence long prior to the recent rise of new financial technology giants.1 Today, several Asian regulators are amending existing rules to allow technology firms to own and run virtual banks, which will likely result in a number of new digital lenders. This has triggered debate and discussion about licensing requirements, risk management, and consumer protection.
Not New but Gaining Traction

The virtual bank is not a new phenomenon in Asia. Japan opened the door for branchless banks in the late 1990s in a wave of financial deregulation and the nation’s first internet bank, Japan Net Bank, has operated since 2000. Over time, Japan Net Bank and other internet banks such as Seven Bank and SBI Sumishin have gained popularity with convenient online banking options and low costs, even though they remain small, niche players. Like Japan, Hong Kong was an early mover, issuing guidelines on the authorization of virtual banks in 2000. Still, the concept of virtual banks only started to take off in Asia recently as booming fintech and an increasingly tech-savvy customer base led authorities to easing ownership requirements for virtual banks.
Allowing Non-Financial Companies to Own Virtual Banks

Participants interested in opening virtual banks include not only traditional banks but also non-financial companies, especially telecom and technology firms. But traditionally, bank ownership by non-financial companies has been capped in most of Asia to prevent spillover of commercial risks to the banking sector and to ensure the public bank safety net does not expand to non-financial owners. In those jurisdictions, before nonfinancial companies can get involved in banking in a meaningful way, authorities often must first take steps to revise existing ownership rules.

In May 2018, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) revised existing guidelines to allow non-financial firms, including technology companies, to own and operate virtual banks via a locally incorporated holding company, a departure from the previous rules that non-financial corporations cannot own more than 50 percent of a bank. Elsewhere, South Korea’s National Assembly passed a bill to raise the non-financial corporations’ maximum stake in banks to 34 percent from the current 4 percent in September. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is amending regulations to permit non-financial corporations to take up to a 60 percent stake in virtual banks.
Asia’s Virtual Banks Open for Business

China has some of the highest profile virtual banks—WeBank and MyBank, which are sponsored and controlled by technology conglomerates Tencent and Alibaba, respectively. They were both among the first five privately owned banks to receive a license from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) in 2015. Both turned a profit one year into operation and continued to report impressive earning figures in 2017. Beyond financial performance, WeBank and MyBank highlight the recurring theme of how large tech conglomerates have expanded their business models by leveraging online commerce, social network platforms, and big data to convert existing users into potential banking customers.

South Korea approved a plan that would grant preliminary banking licenses to two internet banks in 2015. K-bank received its license in 2016 and began operations in 2017—the first time a new bank had been licensed in Korea in 25 years; Kakao Bank followed shortly after. Within a year, the two banks have attracted more than 7 million customers and extended some 8 trillion won (US$ 7.5 billion) worth of consumer credit loans, according to the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC).

More virtual banks are on the way. By August 31, more than 50 companies from across the world have expressed interest in applying for virtual bank licenses in Hong Kong after the HKMA welcomed the establishment of virtual banks in Hong Kong. After finalizing rules for virtual banks in August this year, Taiwan’s FSC is currently planning to issue two virtual bank licenses. Korea’s FSC has also recently announced the intention to grant two more preliminary virtual bank licenses by early next year.
The Allure: Financial Inclusion

For regulators, a top potential benefit of virtual banks is financial inclusion. Unsurprisingly, virtual banks can be run more efficiently than conventional banks. By definition they can avoid the overhead costs that come with maintaining a physical branch network, such as real estate and bank personnel. Virtual banks also tend to offer less complex products, with simpler processes, and can host nonessential services at third party vendors to control costs. Such cost savings can be passed on to customers in the form of lower fees for services and higher rates on deposits. Virtual banks also benefit from scalability, which appeals to regulatory agencies in countries looking to expand financial inclusion.

Regulators have articulated their anticipation for virtual banks to help improve financial inclusion. For instance, the amended HKMA guidelines stated “To bring value to the industry, virtual banks must… play an active role in promoting financial inclusion.” Chinese regulators have similar expectation for privately-owned banks, including the two virtual banks. Both WeBank and MyBank have established the strategy of becoming market leaders in extending small- and micro- loans to households, small businesses and rural borrowers, a substantial demand that conventional banks were not able to meet in the past.
The Challenges: Risk Management and Consumer Protection

Also unsurprisingly, there are plenty of regulatory challenges. Money-laundering and fraud are key risks in the banking industry, and traditional banks have established strict Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes to ensure the identity of customers and curtail risks. Virtual banks, however, encounter a fundamental dilemma in trying to identify customers that it may never see. Regulatory approaches to addressing KYC requirements are different. Korea’s FSC decided to allow customers to open a bank account remotely with a virtual bank. In contrast, Chinese regulators insist on restricting the type of accounts a virtual bank can offer and only allow opening full-service accounts in person, which effectively put restrictions on virtual banks’ business scope and source of funding.

Moreover, the use of technology in lieu of physical branches has opened the door for potential fraud, and raised the issue of how banks should use and treat customer data. Asian regulators appear to be mindful of these issues, and some have written specific rules regarding consumer protection. For example, the HKMA requires each virtual bank to have at least one physical location in order to handle customer complaints. Nonetheless, consumer protection will likely remain a top concern and the challenge will evolve with fintech’s increased participation in providing financial services, calling for more regulatory responses.

Last but not least, virtual lenders typically often focus on the underserved population, which benefits financial inclusion but implies more challenges for risk management. Safety and soundness concerns are especially acute when the banks in question are owned and run by non-financial firms with no prior experience in banking. To address the concern, Asian regulators have stressed that virtual banks are subject to the same minimum licensing criteria and supervisory requirements as traditional firms. Although virtual banks are relatively small in size and arguably not (yet) systemically important, some of them need to create an exit plan as a prerequisite for a banking license in order to minimize potential risks to the public financial safety net. 
Traditional Banks Brace for Challenges

It is still too early to tell whether Asia’s new virtual banks will be able to thrive and achieve long-term growth. After all, internet-only banks have existed for more than a decade in advanced economies like Japan and the United States, but none have become an industry leader despite high levels of internet penetration in both countries. Nonetheless, the emergence of virtual banks has opened the door for non-financial companies to enter the banking industry in several jurisdictions, and traditional banks are feeling the pressure for future competition from niche lenders backed by technology firms and often without physical footprints.

Some are taking a page from virtual banks’ playbooks—MUFG and Mizuho have recently announced their plan to convert retail branches into automated branches, and some Japanese regional banks are taking the same approach. Elsewhere, Singapore’s DBS Group has launched the mobile-based digibank in India and Indonesia. Others are considering partnering with technology firms. In that sense, the challenge posed by virtual banks can also prompt traditional banks to embrace financial technology.

South Korea Eyeing to Grant More Virtual Banking Licenses
by Fintech News Hong Kong	July 31, 2019 
South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), the government’s top financial regulator, will resume a new round of procedures for granting preliminary approval for digital banks, the FSC said on July 17.

Earlier this year, the FSC said it intended to approve one or two additional digital banks under the Special Act on Online-only Banks, which allows non-financial companies to own a 34% stake in an online-only bank.

Two companies applied, namely Kiwoom and Toss, but neither of them was granted a preliminary approval in last May as both fell short of the evaluation committee’s standards.

The regulator now said it will open a new round of procedures for companies looking to operate in the digital banking space. Applications will open on October 10, 2019 and will run until October 15, 2019, and only a maximum of two companies will be granted preliminary approval.

The FSC said that some improvements will be made to the process. In particular, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) will provide applicants with consultation over the whole process of application.

If necessary, the chairman of the evaluation committee will be attending the FSC meetings to explain evaluation criteria so that FSC commissioners will be able to have in-depth discussions and reviews on the committee’s evaluation results.

Applicants will also be given opportunities to express their opinions during the committee’s evaluation process.

The FSC said it will announce whether a preliminary approval has been granted within 60 days upon the data of application. In the case of an official approval, the company will be notified within one month upon the date of application for official approval.

 
Only two digital banks in South Korea

There are currently only two digital banks in South Korea: Kakao Bank, which is built on the back of the country’s highly popular messaging platform Kakao Talk; and K Bank, which was launched three earlier than Kakao Bank but has struggled to gain similar traction.

Kakao Bank started operations as a mobile-only bank in July 2017 and attracted two million customers in its first two weeks of life.

According to Young-Suk Kim, EY Korea’s financial services advisory partner, the appeal of Kakao Bank comes from the fact that the digital bank provides low-cost, better-quality mobile apps, products and services, and focuses on making things simple and convenient for the customer.

The digital bank’s success has pushed incumbents to renew their mobile apps and processes, as well as train their employees to provide better advice and more complex products for consumers, Kim told the Edge.

As of the end of April 2019, Kakao Bank had 9.3 million customers, 16 trillion won in deposits (US$13 billion) and 10 trillion won (US$8 billion) in loan balances.

 
A pro fintech government

The South Korean government has been working to create a favorable environment for fintech development.

The FSC recently selected five additional fintech solutions into its financial regulatory sandbox: a micro-investment service by Shinhan Investment; a brokerage service of foreign currency transfer service providers by E9Pay; a platform providing pet insurance policy holders with points that can be used in pet facilities by SmallTicket; a credit score rating service using non-financial and non-structured data collected from PG and VAN service providers and fintech firms by Hyundai Card; and a payment service for subcontractors using escrow accounts by ZikBank.

As of July 25, 2019, 42 services have been approved to be tested in the regulatory sandbox.

100th day anniversary of financial regulatory sandbox, Financial Services Commission, July 09, 2019

Fintech has gained notable traction over the past few years in South Korea. In 2018, more than 279.2 billion won (US$235 million) was deposited into fintech accounts, a 52% increase from a year earlier.

The FSC said this week that efforts are underway to revise a law governing online financial business operators to protect money deposited into accounts managed by fintech firms, according to a report by the Korea Times.

“Specifics will be finalized in the latter half of 2019 upon the passage of pending bills. Various measures are under consideration,” an FSC official said.

    “The fintechs have grown at a rapid pace over the past few years, increasing the need for the government to implement corresponding regulations. The new measures will seek to boost consumer protection.”

The regulator recently approved Kakao’s application to become the largest shareholder of its internet-only bank subsidiary Kakao Bank."

South Korea’s fintech race heats up
AN inflow of new players is likely to intensify the heated digitalisation race in South Korea’s financial industry this year, along with the industry-wide efforts to expand the scope of business and accelerate innovation.

Taking a bold step in a heavily regulated country in terms of customer information protection and security, traditional banks and financial institutions a few weeks ago started what is called an open banking service.

Offering new business opportunities to small-sized financial technology companies with the open access of customer data, the open banking system allows users to check their accounts at any local bank via a single mobile app.

With the new banking system, consumers can now compare and utilise loan and savings products of different banks more conveniently.

The move came amid mounting concerns that banks and financial institutions could be disrupted by emerging fintech companies if they did not respond to rapid changes in the market. Instead of being outpaced by the new players, traditional banking institutions appear to have decided to become a disruptive force themselves.

“Expectations for the fintech industry are running high with the increasing deployment of new services, including My Data and My Payment, this year, ” said a source from the banking industry.

My Data refers to a system that allows users to manage their personal financial information in a single software programme. My Payment enables non-banking fintech startups to offer payment services without the need to have customers’ financial assets.

Tech-savvy firms like Viva Republica, a fintech unicorn and the operator of money transfer app Toss, and tech giant Naver are likely to up the ante in the competition this year.

In December, Viva Republica attracted fresh investment of 64 billion won (RM224.6mil), with its corporate value approximately reaching 2.7 trillion won. The valuation is larger than that of other traditional financial and banking firms in Seoul, except the nation’s five largest financial groups – KB Financial Group, Shinhan Financial Group, Hana Financial Group, Woori Financial Group and NH Financial Group.

The new funding came after Viva Republica received the green light from the Financial Services Commission to launch the nation’s third internet-only bank in early December – seven months after its first application was rejected.

With the investment, the fintech unicorn will likely roll out new loan, or even stock trading services.

“The planned launch of Toss Bank will surely heat up competition with the existing online banks, Kakao Bank and K bank, ” said Lee Dong-yoon, an analyst from KB Securities, adding the short-term impact in the overall market could be limited, as there is still a year left before the bank is launched.

Some market analysts also warned that traditional banks will have to brace themselves for the impact of the arrival of Toss in the banking industry, as they could lose customers to their online competitor.

Web portal giant Naver is preparing to flex its technology muscles in the fintech segment this year as well. Joining forces with Softbank, Naver is scheduled to establish Z Holdings this year, a holding firm that will have mobile messenger firm Line and web portal operator Yahoo Japan under its wing. The two partners will each have 50% of the holding company.

While a range of new services are expected to launch through the partnership, the partners’ payment services, among others, will likely gain growth momentum based on Naver and Yahoo’s huge user bases, which reach 2.3 billion, mostly in Asia.

Korean mobile payment services providers, including Kakao and NHN, are also going beyond their comfort zones in Korea, eyeing bigger opportunities in global markets. Mobile messenger firm Kakao has launched its mobile payment solution KakaoPay in Japan and Macao, allowing users to pay for their offline purchases in the local markets with the mobile app. While NHN, which runs mobile payment app Payco, is trying to infiltrate Asian markets, including Japan and Taiwan, and North American markets.

“Payco boasts the largest number of offline business partners, including restaurants and stores, in Korea. Based on its presence and tech capability in the local market, the company will try to bring cross-border fintech services to other nations, ” an NHN spokesperson said.

Consumer transactions generated from card and electronic payments in the Asia-Pacific region are forecast to double from US$18.7 trillion (RM76.8 trillion) in 2018 to US$39.4 trillion in 2024, according to global market research firm Euromonitor International’s report published in November.

Some financial behemoths are sparing no efforts to nurture fintech startups as part of their efforts to find new growth engines and go global.

KB Financial Group and Shinhan Financial Group recently partnered with US accelerator Plug&Play to help nurture and bring fledgling fintech firms to global markets. The startup accelerator, which runs support programmes, has more than 10,000 startups and 300 official corporate partners. Unicorns like PayPal and Dropbox have participated in its programmes. — The Korea Herald/ANN"

3 Banking in Asia-PacificForewordThe Asia–Pacific (APAC) banking sector offers opportunities for all banks. But, with disruptors and platform players redefining the financial services landscape, and with banks’ profitability under pressure, not all banks can be winners. To succeed, incumbent players must accelerate their digital maturity and exploit their unique strengths. In particular, to optimize, grow and protect their business, they must embrace: • Intelligent automation to deliver efficiencies• Open application programming interfaces (APIs) to allow them to participate in the emerging data–sharing ecosystem and realize new growth opportunities• Digital strategies to manage financial crime and cybersecurity risks Incumbent banks cannot afford to keep ceding territory to digital disruptors. As customer preferences are shaped by their digital experiences outside of banking, alternative providers delivering financial offerings are making their presence felt. These nontraditional players are often better able to address customer expectations of a fast, frictionless experience through bespoke services, digital infrastructure and platform ecosystems.To defend their turf and get ready for the banking ecosystem of the future, APAC banks must ask themselves:• Does my strategy take advantage of changing revenue opportunities?• How do I innovate for agility, efficiency and growth?• Am I sufficiently considering new risks and the need to embed cybersecurity in my strategy?• How can I use my traditional strengths to compete?Winning banks in the fast–evolving APAC banking landscape will be those that deliver leaner, more agile business models; who play to their strengths and who not only understand their customers, but also move forward with them.Andrew GilderEY Asia–Pacific Banking & Capital Markets Leader3Banking in Asia–Pacific

For example:• Client onboarding: Manually intensive onboarding processes could be digitized, end to end. In this regard, technologies, such as blockchain, that address digital identity may be game changers in the longer term. • Client insight and analytics: Using advanced analytics on position and transaction data can identify patterns and trends for relationship managers. Advanced analytics and unstructured data engineering can be applied to natural language inputs, market news, economic reports, monetary policy changes and political events, to gain richer insights, more quickly than human research teams.• Trading: Advanced analytics can improve the performance of front–office desks. By analyzing actual trades executed and comparing them with market news and the data available to the trader, algorithms can identify suboptimal trading strategies. Accelerated liberalization of China’s financial sector offers opportunitiesAs restrictions ease, foreign players are likely to expand their investment in China’s financial sector. Changes will take time but are expected to be significant. Among the major changes are:• Institutions: The foreign ownership caps in banks (individual foreign shareholder: 20% and all foreign share   holders: 25%) are removed, facilitating M&A with Chinese commercial banks. Foreign investors can increase their equity holdings in securities, futures and fund companies, initially to 51% and, after three years, to 100%. Already, there are examples of foreign investors taking control of their securities joint ventures in China and obtaining approval to establish new foreign-funded securities companies. • Businesses: Newly-established joint venture securities companies will immediately be able to apply for business licenses, the same as domestic institutions. This includes businesses such as securities brokerage, investment consulting and proprietary trading, which were not previously permitted. Foreign banks will no longer require approval to conduct Renminbi business, allowing them to conduct both Renminbi and foreign currency business.• Capital markets: There have been significant capital markets initiatives in recent years. Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and the “Northbound” bond connect have been introduced, which diversify the means for overseas financial institutions to participate in China’s capital market. China’s A-shares have been officially included in the MSCI index and China’s bonds will also be gradually included in the Bloomberg Barclays Bond Index.Although China’s financial sector reforms have eased restrictions for foreign participants, this does not mean lower regulatory standards. Foreign financial institutions will need to pay attention to business operation capability, quality and efficiency. Greater foreign ownership will help lay a solid foundation for the globalization of the Renminbi, the development of the bond and capital market, and relaxation of capital inflows and outflows in the future. The initiatives launched so far reflect China’s commitment to opening up the financial sector, guided by ongoing improvement in response to market needs."

How KakaoBank is bringing innovation to the banking industry, at last

Messaging platform KakaoTalk has successfully entered the banking industry in Korea after obtaining a license from the regulator FSC in April this year. It was designated as one of the two online-only banks in the nation. This will likely be a critical disruption to a sector that has enjoyed a long period of stability but has lacked innovation.

KakaoBank was established in January 2016. It is led by chat platform KakaoTalk which has a 10% stake but the major shareholder is Korea Investment Holdings, a major financial group in Korea. It has positioned itself as a mobile only bank with no physical branches. All activities occur over the app which is a natural extension from its main messaging app KakaoTalk. KakaoBank fully leveraged the advantage of being linked to the leading messaging platform in Korea, KakaoTalk which is used by 42 million users out of the 50 million population in Korea.

Within just 24 hours of opening on July 27th 300,000 new accounts were opened with KakaoBank (this is more than what all other Korean banks got in 2016 through online channels). The number continued to rise throughout August. We estimate KakaoBank took close to 45% market share in all new bank accounts opened in August – including both offline and online. If we only count the mobile internet based accounts it was almost a 70% share. It extended US$1.2 billion in credit loans during August and this again accounted for 40% of the country’s total loans during the month.

Opening a bank account only took 5-7 minutes on average and the only document required was a photo of your ID card. This is revolutionary as it saves the time and effort of visiting a bank, waiting in line and then filling out lengthy forms.

The ease of opening an account was not the only selling factor, KakaoBank also offered loans with interest rates that were as low as 2.86% compared to the 6-19% range of traditional banks. The approval process was also as quick and easy as the account opening.

The third factor was the low commission fee on overseas money transfers. The rate offered was as low as US$5 which is again almost much lower than traditional banks, so it was hard to think of a reason not to open a KakaoBank account. The fourth factor was the relatively high deposit rate which was 1.2% in annualized rates.

There were some skeptics on the quality of KakaoBank’s customer base, but those figures look solid as well. Over 70% of the customers have also applied for a bank check card which shows the actual usage rate of the bank accounts. Also 88% of the loan applicants have high credit scores meaning their credit is good enough for competitive rates.

KakaoBank’s revolution can be summarized in two words, “speed” and “convenience”. Consumers had been waiting for innovation to come to the finance sector and KakaoBank has delivered this by offering speed and convenience through a smartphone. KakaoBank took advantage of its dominant messaging platform, KakaoTalk, which lowered its marketing expenses and brought a feeling of security through the familiarity of the brand. We expect KakaoBank to enter the list of top six or seven banks in the country by next year.

Despite initial success, KakaoBank will have to stay alert as there will be many challenges ahead. The lucrative mortgage loan market remains untouched as the mobile-only screening is not sufficient. Also, the existing customer support cannot keep up with the growing client base, so there needs to be constant investment in the infrastructure to scale with demand.

As KakaoBank grows to a sizeable level, regulatory issues are bound to arise. The government might realize that there are needs to implement stringent compliance measures and screening processes as there is always a risk of identity theft and fraud. Such cases could potentially increase with the growing client base.

It’s a good start for a new breed of bank born purely from mobile and the net interest margin of 2.5%, which is the difference between the loan interest and the savings, looks good for healthy growth. Since the birth of smartphones, there has been a mobile revolution going on and there will be no industry left undisrupted. The finance industry is no exception. In contrast with the success of KakaoBank, Citigroup has announced plans to shut down almost 70% of its branches in Korea this year and Standard Chartered is also considering reducing 25% of its branches in the country. With KakaoBank in business, this trend will only be accelerated. Korea is just one example and this may now happen in China, Europe, Japan and anywhere else in the world where there is a high rate of penetration of digital banking. Korea has been considered as an economy with the highest penetration of digital banking, with 96% of the population using online banking in 2014, which made it ripe for innovation. We believe that the financial industry just might have had its iPhone moment but in a small unnoticed market first. We will see more internet startups entering the financial industry now, challenging traditional brick-and-mortar banks.

Abstract

The purpose of this project is to explore the response of the Korean authorities to the fallout from the financial crisis that began in the fall of 1997. The project is situated in the domestic and international political economy and examines how the Korean government adjusted to practices in global finance and commerce. What is being examined at a practical level is to what extent has there been policy learning about financial policy governance within the Korean state since the 1997 financial collapse. The article concludes that there has not been enough political, social and institutional development in financial governance to accompany the purely economic advances.
Keywords: Policy learning, liberalization, Korea, financial crisis
Introduction

The purpose of this project is to explore the response of the Korean authorities to the fallout from the financial crisis that began in the fall of 1997. The analysis is informed by my earlier work (Harris 2003) which focused on the weakness of governance institutions and was set against the Korean accession process to membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The present project, situated in the domestic and international political economy, examines how the Korean government adjusts to practices in global finance and commerce. What is being examined at a practical level is to what extent has there been policy learning about financial policy governance within the Korean state.

In the period prior to the 1997 debacle Korea was a financial crisis waiting to happen. This was the unfortunate state of affairs because of inadequate financial regulatory oversight, state interference in credit allocation decisions, and an absence of responsible and accountable corporate governance. This confluence of events (a sort of democratic deficit), plus the premature opening of the short-term capital account gave rise to and exacerbated the severity of the crisis. Furthermore, there was a great deal of external pressure emanating from the US Treasury (acting the behest of the American financial services industry) and to a lesser extent, from other OECD members, for Korea to relax the protectionist regulatory environment surrounding its financial sector in order to conform with the OECD Codes of Liberalization.

Unfortunately, Korea, at the time an unconsolidated democracy, had not adequately pursued the values of democratic capitalism that were so necessary for enduring success in the world of global commerce and finance. Core beliefs in both the public policy and private sectors had not

adjusted to this new transnational environment. Highlighting the absence of so-called ‘global standards’ of governance in Korea is a critique of Korea's willingness to participate in first world activities with both a third world governance infrastructure (institutions) and core beliefs. 1 This was a catastrophic recipe.

The main burden of the crisis fell on the ordinary workers (Harris 2002). The chaebols as organizations are by and large still in tact, though smaller in number, and institutionally remain very powerful. A good part of the banking system was taken over by the state, and their balance sheets cleaned up at taxpayers' expense. The banks were subsequently privatized, with sales to both domestic and offshore entities. 2 However, the role of foreigners in Korean commerce has not been accepted in a passive manner by Korean civic society (Kwok 2006, Yonhap News 2006).

The conventional wisdom among financial commentators and economic analysts is that South Korea has recovered from the immediate effects of the 1997 crisis (The Economist 2002). 3 Such conclusions arose from the analysis of the country's legislated legal and intended institutional reforms, its national economic accounts, anecdotal evidence about improvements in corporate governance, and the perception that banks had cleaned up their imprudent credit practices. Indeed, there appears two phases in the recovery period: 1997–2002 when many institutional reforms were introduced but had not fully taken root; and since then when the new institutional framework and bureaucratic professionalism accompanied by the commitment to global standards became more conspicuous – although pressing prudential oversight difficulties persist.

On balance, this ‘net’ positive assessment emerges despite the reckless increases in the issuance of credit cards to consumers, the rapid expansion of mortgage credit which fuelled a bubble in the residential real estate market beginning in the 2001–2002 period, and the more recent debt-load problems of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The balance sheets of ordinary citizens in the post-crisis period began mirroring those of the chaebols in the period leading up to the 1997 crisis. These developments suggested imprudence on the part of both lenders and borrowers and a lack of sufficient and timely oversight by the prudential regulator (Lee 2002). The inflation of values in the real estate market reflected weaknesses in macroeconomic management as well as a power struggle between the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) and the central bank – the Bank of Korea (BoK) – over the proper balance of market-based monetary policy instruments and intrusive quantitative controls. The SME problem is rooted in the continued intrusive activities of the state.

One would not dispute that the real economy has recovered from the effects of the crisis. In the past few years (since 2004), however, the economic cycle has been dampened, consumers, the chaebols, and some SMEs have put their balance sheets on a more sustainable path. The incremental steps towards a more market-oriented economy (OECD 2005, pp. 20–23) are manifested in the adoption of inflation control targets by the central bank (Bank of Korea 2006b). 4 Most recently, corporate governance in the financial and industrial sectors has made headway. The bureaucracy has worked hard, and seemingly successfully, to implement global standards for effective prudential oversight in finance (particularly in the commercial bank sector). Industrial–financial links, which were a source of abuse, have been limited compared to the pre-crisis period. Moreover, transparency surrounding prudential oversight has improved dramatically – as measured by the public reporting by the key institutions involved in this essential public policy area. However, the main issue for Korea is whether there has been sufficient policy learning among the official bureaucracy and elected officials and whether good financial and corporate governance can be sustained.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: the next section will provide a stylized review of the institutional weaknesses and the domestic and international political imperatives which contributed to the crises; Section 3 will examine some theoretical precepts surrounding the policy learning literature; Section 4 looks at the initial state response to the crisis and the intended ‘ideal-type’ institutional changes; Sections 5 and 6 provide an assessment of the changes in Korea since the crisis; and the final section contains some conclusions."

SINGAPORE: Singapore's central bank is studying whether to allow financial technology firms to operate digital-only banks in the city-state, it said, following moves by regulators in other Asian markets to issue virtual banking licences.

Singapore is among several financial centres in the region, such as Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo, pushing to become a fintech hotspot. Measures in recent years include state funding, light-touch regulation and moves to allow start-ups to test financial products in a controlled environment.

""Technology and other non-bank firms have been making large digital strides, and they have brought substantive value to their customers in doing so. Some of these non-bank firms have established digital-only banks, either amongst themselves or in partnership with incumbent banks,"" the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in response to a query from Reuters on Tuesday (May 7).

""MAS is studying whether to admit such digital-only banks with non-bank parentage.""

The central bank said it has engaged relevant stakeholders to determine the value they bring to the local banking landscape and ""understand how potential risks will be managed and contained.""

Hong Kong's banking regulator this year issued so-called virtual banking licences to four companies including fintech firm WeLab Digital Limited. In South Korea, authorities have issued two online-only bank licences, one of them to Kakao Bank in 2017, which is operated by the company behind the country’s largest chat app.

 What Is Financial Technology – Fintech?

Financial technology (Fintech) is used to describe new tech that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. ​​​At its core, fintech is utilized to help companies, business owners and consumers better manage their financial operations, processes, and lives by utilizing specialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and, increasingly, smartphones. Fintech, the word, is a combination of ""financial technology"". 

When fintech emerged in the 21st Century, the term was initially applied to the technology employed at the back-end systems of established financial institutions. ​Since then, however, there has been a shift to more consumer-oriented services and therefore a more consumer-oriented definition. Fintech now includes different sectors and industries such as education, retail banking, fundraising and nonprofit, and investment management to name a few.

Fintech also includes the development and use of crypto-currencies such as bitcoin. That segment of fintech may see the most headlines, the big money still lies in the traditional global banking industry and its multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization.

Fintech
Understanding Fintech

Broadly, the term ""financial technology"" can apply to any innovation in how people transact business, from the invention of digital money to double-entry bookkeeping. Since the internet revolution and the mobile internet/smartphone revolution, however, financial technology has grown explosively, and fintech, which originally referred to computer technology applied to the back office of banks or trading firms, now describes a broad variety of technological interventions into personal and commercial finance.

Fintech now describes a variety of financial activities, such as money transfers, depositing a check with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising money for a business startup, or managing your investments, generally without the assistance of a person. According to EY's 2017 Fintech Adoption Index, one-third of consumers utilize at least two or more fintech services and those consumers are also increasingly aware of fintech as a part of their daily lives.
Key Takeaways

    Fintech refers to the integration of technology into offerings by financial services companies in order to improve their use and delivery to consumers.
    It primarily works by unbundling offerings by such firms and creating new markets for them. Startups disrupt incumbents in the finance industry by expanding financial inclusion and using technology to cut down on operational costs.
    Fintech funding is on the rise but regulatory problems abound.

Fintech in Practice

The most talked-about (and most funded) fintech startups share the same characteristic: they are designed to be a threat to, challenge, and eventually usurp entrenched traditional financial services providers by being more nimble, serving an underserved segment or providing faster and/or better service.

For example, Affirm seeks to cut credit card companies out of the online shopping process by offering a way for consumers to secure immediate, short-term loans for purchases. While rates can be high, Affirm claims to offer a way for consumers with poor or no credit a way to both secure credits and also build their credit histories. Similarly, Better Mortgage seeks to streamline the home mortgage process (and obviate traditional mortgage brokers) with a digital-only offering that can reward users with a verified pre-approval letter within 24 hours or applying. GreenSky seeks to link home improvement borrowers with banks by helping consumers avoid entrenched lenders and save on interest by offering zero-interest promotional periods.

For consumers with no or poor credit, Tala offers consumers in the developing world microloans by doing a deep data dig on their smartphones for their transaction history and seemingly unrelated things, such as what mobile games they play. Tala seeks to give such consumers better options than local banks, unregulated lenders and other microfinance institutions.

In short, if you have ever wondered why some aspect of your financial life was so unpleasant (such as applying for a mortgage with a traditional lender) or felt like it wasn't quite the right fit, fintech probably has (or seeks to have) a solution for you. For example, fintech seeks to answer questions like, ""Why is what makes up my FICO score so mysterious and how it is used to judge my creditworthiness?""

As such, loan originator Upstart wants to make FICO (as well as other lenders both traditional and fintech) obsolete by using different data sets to determine creditworthiness. They include employment history, education, and whether a would-be borrower knows their credit score to decide on whether to underwrite and how to price loans. Similar treatment is given to financial services that range from bridge loans for house flippers (LendingHome), to a digital investment platform that addresses the fact that women live longer and have unique savings requirements, tend to earn less than men and have different salary curves that can leave less time for savings to grow (Ellevest). 
Fintech's Expanding Horizons

Up until now, financial services institutions offered a variety of services under a single umbrella. The scope of these services encompassed a broad range from traditional banking activities to mortgage and trading services. In its most basic form, Fintech unbundles these services into individual offerings. The combination of streamlined offerings with technology enables fintech companies to be more efficient and cut down on costs associated with each transaction.

If one word can describe how many fintech innovations have affected traditional trading, banking, financial advice, and products, it's 'disruption,' like financial products and services that were once the realm of branches, salesmen and desktops move toward mobile devices or simply democratize away from large, entrenched institutions.

For example, the mobile-only stock trading app Robinhood charges no fees for trades, and peer-to-peer lending sites like Prosper Marketplace, Lending Club and OnDeck promise to reduce rates by opening up competition for loans to broad market forces. Business loan providers such as Kabbage, Lendio, Accion and Funding Circle (among others) offer startup and established businesses easy, fast platforms to secure working capital. Oscar, an online insurance startup, received $165 million in funding in March 2018. Such significant funding rounds are not unusual and occur globally for fintech startups.

Entrenched, traditional banks have been paying attention, however, and have invested heavily into becoming more like the companies that seek to disrupt them. For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs launched consumer lending platform Marcus in 2016 and recently expanded its operations to the United Kingdom.

That said, many tech-savvy industry watchers warn that keeping apace of fintech-inspired innovations requires more than just ramped up tech spend. Rather, competing with lighter-on-their-feet startups requires a significant change in thinking, processes, decision-making, and even overall corporate structure.
Fintech and New Tech

New technologies, like machine learning/artificial intelligence, predictive behavioral analytics, and data-driven marketing, will take the guesswork and habit out of financial decisions. ""Learning"" apps will not only learn the habits of users, often hidden to themselves, but will engage users in learning games to make their automatic, unconscious spending and saving decisions better. Fintech is also a keen adaptor of automated customer service technology, utilizing chatbots to and AI interfaces to assist customers with basic task and also keep down staffing costs. Fintech is also being leveraged to fight fraud by leveraging information about payment history to flag transactions that are outside the norm.
Fintech Landscape

Fintech startups received $17.4 billion in funding in 2016 and were on pace to surpass that sum as of late 2017, according to CB Insights, which counted 26 fintech unicorns globally valued at $83.8 billion. The same firm reported that there were 39 VC-backed fintech unicorns worth $147.37 billion by the end of 2018.

North America produces most of the fintech startups, with Asia a relatively close second. Global fintech funding hit a new high in the first quarter of 2018 let by a significant uptick in deals in North America. Asia, which could surpass the United States in fintech deals, also saw a spike in activity. Funding activity in Europe was at a five-quarter low in Q1 2018 but surged back in Q2. 

Some of the most active areas of fintech innovation include or revolve around the following areas:

    Cryptocurrency and digital cash.
    Blockchain technology, including Ethereum, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that maintain records on a network of computers, but has no central ledger.
    Smart contracts, which utilize computer programs (often utilizing the blockchain) to automatically execute contracts between buyers and sellers.
    Open banking, a concept that leans on the blockchain and posits that third-parties should have access to bank data to build applications that create a connected network of financial institutions and third-party providers. An example is the all-in-one money management tool Mint.
    Insurtech, which seeks to use technology to simplify and streamline the insurance industry.
    Regtech, which seeks to help financial service firms meet industry compliance rules, especially those covering Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer protocols which fight fraud.
    Robo-advisors, such as Betterment, utilize algorithms to automate investment advice to lower its cost and increase accessibility.
    Unbanked/underbanked, services that seek to serve disadvantaged or low-income individuals who are ignored or underserved by traditional banks or mainstream financial services companies.
    Cybersecurity, given the proliferation of cybercrime and the decentralized storage of data, cybersecurity and fintech are intertwined.

Fintech Users

There are four broad categories of users for fintech: 1) B2B for banks and 2) their business clients, and 3) B2C for small businesses and 4) consumers. Trends toward mobile banking, increased information, data, and more accurate analytics and decentralization of access will create opportunities for all four groups to interact in heretofore unprecedented ways.

As for consumers, as with most technology, the younger you are the more likely it will be that you are aware of and can accurately describe what fintech is. The fact is that consumer-oriented fintech is mostly targeted toward millennials given the huge size and rising earning (and inheritance) potential of that much-talked-about segment. Some fintech watchers believe that this focus on millennials has more to do with the size of that marketplace than the ability and interest of Gen Xers and Baby Boomers in using fintech. Rather, fintech tends to offer little to older consumers because it fails to address their problems.

When it comes to businesses, before the advent and adoption of fintech, a business owner or startup would have gone to a bank to secure financing or startup capital. If they intended to accept credit card payments they would have to establish a relationship with a credit provider and even install infrastructure, such as a landline-connected card reader. Now, with mobile technology, those hurdles are a thing of the past.
Regulation and Fintech

Financial services are among the most heavily regulated sectors in the world. Not surprisingly, regulation has emerged as the number one concern among governments as fintech companies take off.

As technology is integrated into financial services processes, regulatory problems for such companies have multiplied. In some instances, the problems are a function of technology. In others, they are a reflection of the tech industry's impatience to disrupt finance.

For example, automation of processes and digitization of data makes fintech systems vulnerable to attacks from hackers. Recent instances of hacks at credit card companies and banks are illustrations of the ease with which bad actors can gain access to systems and cause irreparable damage. The most important questions for consumers in such cases will pertain to the responsibility for such attacks as well as misuse of personal information and important financial data.

There have also been instances where the collision of a technology culture that believes in a ""Move fast and break things"" philosophy with the conservative and risk-averse world of finance has produced undesirable results. San Francisco-based insurtech startup Zenefits, which was valued at over a billion dollars in private markets, broke California's insurance laws by allowing unlicensed brokers to sell its products and underwrite insurance policies. The SEC fined the firm $980,000 and they had to pay $7 million to California's Department of Insurance.

Regulation is also a problem in the emerging world of cryptocurrencies. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a new form of fundraising that allows startups to raise capital directly from lay investors. In most countries, they are unregulated and have become fertile ground for scams and frauds. Regulatory uncertainty for ICOs has also allowed entrepreneurs to slip security tokens disguised as utility tokens past the SEC to avoid fees and compliance costs.

Because of the diversity of offerings in fintech and the disparate industries it touches, it is difficult to formulate a single and comprehensive approach to these problems. For the most part, governments have used existing regulations and, in some cases, customized them to regulate fintech.

They have established fintech sandboxes to evaluate the implications of technology in the sector. The passing of General Data Protection Regulation, a framework for collecting and using personal data, in the EU is another attempt to limit the amount of personal data available to banks. Several countries where ICOs are popular, such as Japan and South Korea, have also taken the lead in developing regulations for such offerings to protect investors.

doc21,"2019 Banking Industry Outlook
Optimism for banking and capital markets

There’s a new kind of promise in the banking industry—and possibly no better time than now for transformation. Economic fundamentals are strong, the regulatory climate is favorable, and transformation technologies are more readily accessible, powerful, and economical than ever before.
Calmer waters: A decade after the financial crisis, the banking industry is on firmer ground.
The global banking system is not only bigger and more profitable but also more resilient than at any time in the last 10 years (figure 1). According to The Banker’s Top 1000 World Banks Ranking for 2018, total assets reached $124 trillion, while return on assets (ROA) stood at 0.90 percent. Similarly, tier 1 capital ratio as a proportion of assets rose to 6.7 percent, significantly higher than in 2008.1

But the recovery since the financial crisis has not been uniform across regions. US banks, compared to their European counterparts, are ahead on multiple measures. Aggressive policy interventions and forceful regulations helped propel US banks to health more quickly. And more recently, favorable GDP growth, tax cuts, and rising rates have further bolstered the state of the industry.

Total assets in the United States reached a peak of $17.5 trillion.2 Capital levels are up as well, with average tier 1 capital ratio standing at 13.14 percent. Return on equity (ROE) for the industry is at a post-crisis high of 11.83 percent.3 Efficiency ratios also are at their best. Similarly, on other metrics, such as nonperforming loans and number of failed institutions, the US banking industry is robust.

However, the same cannot be said of the banking industry in Europe. Structural deficiencies, overcapacity, low/negative interest rates, and the absence of a pan-European banking regulatory agency have all likely contributed to European banks experiencing persistent profitability challenges.

Many European banks have become smaller, retrenching from international markets and exiting former profitable businesses. Consider the fact that profits of the top five European banks dropped from $60 billion in 2007 to $17.5 billion in 2017.4 However, European banks are showing some improvement. ROE for the Western European banks in the top 1,000 world banks grew to 8.6 percent in 2017, compared with 5.5 percent in 2016.5

In the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, the growth of Chinese banks has been the most stunning development in the last 10 years. The Chinese banking industry has surpassed that of the European Union (EU) in terms of size. The world’s four largest banks in 2018 are Chinese; in 2007, none of the top 10 banks in the world were Chinese.6 Chinese banks are also doing well in terms of profitability—the larger banks reported a 15.3 percent ROE in 2017.7 However, the concern with economic growth and the tariff war with the United States are already affecting prospects.8

Meanwhile, Japanese banks, which escaped the financial crisis, have long suffered the effects of slow domestic growth and low/negative interest rates.9

Despite this overall optimistic picture for the global banking industry, uncertainties loom on the horizon. Real GDP growth forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) point to a deceleration in all regions, including China and Emerging Asia (figure 2). In the latest forecast, Deloitte economists are predicting a 25 percent probability of a recession in the United States in 2019. In this scenario, tariffs and dilution of the stimulus effect could weaken the US economic growth in late 2019 or early 2020.10

And on the regulatory front, global divergence shows no signs of abating as governments continue to buck previous post-crisis trends of synchronization. To spur economic growth, local jurisdictions are increasingly implementing their own standards, sometimes in patchwork.

While net new regulations in the United States appear unlikely, the reprieve has largely been confined to the smaller and midsize banks. Large banks, despite potential relief from the Volcker Rule, are expected to continue to operate under the same regulatory agenda.

In the technology arena, the promise of exponential technologies seems more real than ever. While the wild enthusiasm with blockchain has tapered off, the industry continues to sail toward a blockchain future. However, the energy might now lie with artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud, as they are already transforming many aspects of banking in significant ways.

But for any of these technologies to have maximal impact, data is key. Although data is plentiful, it is often not easily accessible, clean enough, nor integrated.

Meanwhile, the relationships between banks, fintechs, and bigtechs are evolving rapidly. Fintechs are increasingly no longer seen as scrappy adversaries—collaboration with incumbents is more the norm. With increasing industry convergence, the relationship between the banking industry and bigtech can be characterized as a bit guarded. Banks typically need bigtech, and in some ways bigtechs also need banks, as the banking industry remains a big revenue source for many technology companies.

Last year, we urged banks and capital markets institutions to accelerate their transformation, particularly digital transformation. No doubt many banks have embraced digital transformation across the banking and capital markets value chain.

But how much of this change is purposeful and strategic? Change for change’s sake typically only begets disappointment. Banks should bolster their conviction and reimagine transformation as a holistic, multiyear process, and ""change how they change."" The world is becoming too volatile, and external change is happening more rapidly than before. Taking a traditional approach in confronting these challenges may not work. “Change the bank” initiatives should move to the fore and could essentially become the new operating model for “running the bank.”

This transformation should fundamentally start with banks reaffirming their role in the global financial system. What do they want to be in the next five or 10 years?

Banks should discard grand visions of becoming “a technology company” and instead focus on customers, enhance trust as financial intermediaries, facilitate capital flows, and provide credit to the global economy with data as the bond that sustains the amalgam of technologies—AI, automation, cloud, core modernization, etc.—best suited for the purpose.

Future-proofing the business

Our main message, though, is the following: There may be no better time than now to reimagine transformation. Economic fundamentals are stronger than at any time in the last decade. The regulatory climate is not going to get any more challenging. And, technologies to enable transformation are not only getting more powerful but also more readily accessible, easily implementable, and economical than before.

Indeed, there appears to be a new kind of promise in the banking industry.

We urge banks not to become complacent. The economic/credit cycle is bound to turn at some point. Use recent fortunes to invest wisely, and pursue change with clarity and conviction.

In this report—the 2019 Banking and Capital Markets Outlook—we discuss the need for strategic transformation in the following areas in 2019: Regulatory compliance, tax, technology, risk, privacy, and talent. We then lay out our expectations in seven primary business segments: retail banking, corporate banking, transaction banking, investment banking, payments, wealth management, and market infrastructure (figure 3).

Regulation: A new era of global regulatory divergence

Last year, we predicted a stabilization on the regulatory front after years of intense scrutiny by regulators around the globe. Much has happened since then. Growing divergence in global regulatory standards remains a fact. As countries look for ways to spur economic growth, many are increasingly showing a willingness to take a fragmented approach, bucking the previous trend of post-crisis synchronization.

In the United States, the focus on refining or even replacing existing regulations remains. A new bill, Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, amending certain provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. Notably, the statutory systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) asset thresholds for enhanced prudential regulations, such as stress tests and capital and liquidity ratios, were increased, giving the most relief to banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion.

As for the Volcker Rule, several changes are still pending. The proposal intends to modify the scope of applicability based on trading size, amend proprietary trading provisions, and simplify compliance reporting. It also offers some relief to foreign banking organizations (FBOs).11

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), requiring banks to serve the credit needs of their communities, may also be revised. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has begun seeking public comment on ways to amend this act.12

The Department of Labor’s (DOL’s) fiduciary rule, requiring financial institutions to act in the best interest of their clients, was overturned, but a new best-interest rule from the SEC is still a possibility. Meanwhile, enforcement actions by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) have declined. As of September 2018, the CFPB had announced only five enforcement actions since February 2017.13

While the pace of new regulations has decelerated under the current US administration, the role of the states may grow in prominence. As an example, California passed the Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which establishes new data protection rights for consumers. Other states are likely to follow suit.

In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the first of its kind to provide sweeping data protections to EU citizens, will continue to reshape privacy and data ownership policies. Meanwhile, even though the implementation of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) has hit some speed bumps, the drive toward fee transparency will only accelerate. On the other hand, Payment Services Directive II (PSD2) has had the intended effect of promoting innovation and competition in payments.

Additionally, the European Commission (EC) continues to work on completing a single, harmonized regulation rulebook and on finalizing the banking union. However, it has faced headwinds in establishing the banking union because the global trading book capital standards it seeks to incorporate from the Basel Committee’s Fundamental Review of the Trading Book are in flux.14

In the United Kingdom, as the March 2019 Brexit deadline rapidly approaches, much uncertainty remains. Many banks have already established contingency plans, possibly preparing for the worst—either a no-deal or hard Brexit. Depending on what ultimately happens, these plans could be put to the test.

In the APAC region, conduct and culture were high on the regulation agenda in 2018. China’s banking regulators issued extensive guidelines on employee conduct management, while Malaysia’s central bank proposed an accountability framework for senior officials in financial institutions.

In 2018, APAC regulators took a closer look at foreign investment and recovery and resolution planning. India’s central bank, for instance, introduced a new framework for the resolution of stressed assets, and Hong Kong updated its recovery planning legislation in accordance with international norms.15

Meanwhile, in China, the historic step to merge banking and insurance watchdogs might help Chinese regulators better tackle the mounting risk in its financial system.16

Despite growing global regulatory divergence, regulators in the United States and abroad seem to be encouraging experimentation by fintechs and welcoming them to the fold.

The OCC announced in July 2018 that it would begin accepting fintech bank charter applications.17 Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced plans for a network of global regulators—dubbed the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN—to establish a global regulatory “sandbox” that can foster innovation among technology companies.18

The Monetary Authority of Singapore is also taking a sandbox approach to fintech innovation. And, in Japan, the Financial Services Authority is considering a complete regulatory overhaul in response to the expanding influence of fintechs. These changes, if implemented, could have wide-ranging implications for traditional banks.19

With such a dynamic regulatory landscape, banks should buckle down and make compliance modernization a priority in 2019, focusing particularly on making regulatory systems already in place more efficient for business strategy. And, of course, throughout all compliance efforts, banks should prioritize soundness and safety.


Technology: Creating a symphonic enterprise

In our 2018 outlook, we highlighted the hodgepodge of systems, platforms, software, and tools—much of it legacy infrastructure—as a key challenge for bank CIOs. This remains relevant for 2019 as well. Banks’ success in digital transformation will ultimately depend on how strategy, technology, and operations work together across domains. We refer to this as a “symphonic enterprise,”25 where different technologies and solutions are seamlessly meshed to create maximum value.

To achieve this, excelling at data management, modernizing core infrastructure, embracing AI, and migrating to the public cloud should take precedence in 2019 (see figure 4 on the following page).

But a key step in any of this digital transformation is getting a better handle on data to extract the greatest value from technology investments. No doubt many banks have established dedicated data management programs, but success up to this point seems modest at best.

The data challenge becomes more daunting as data integrity increases in importance. Regulatory expectations will further elevate the role of effective data management. PSD2 mandates that banks make customer data more accessible to third parties, while GDPR forces banks to ensure the privacy of their customer data. Not managing the conflicting priorities could raise operational risk for banks.

The challenge for many banks is that data, for the most part, is being managed in siloed, disparate systems, which complicates banks’ ability to know and serve their clients.

Of course, core system modernization is not a new goal for many, so what is different now? As banks accelerate their digital transformation efforts, relying on a patchwork of archaic systems can pose significant risk. And, as banks consider adopting technologies like machine learning—and eventually blockchain and quantum computing—how well suited are existing systems to run, grow, and secure a modern digital bank?

The good news is that more banks are taking the leap, but at their own pace. Some banks have completely replaced their legacy systems, while others, such as Nordea, are following their lead with multiyear modernization initiatives.26 Others have eschewed the “rip and replace” method in favor of microservices and cloud applications, while gradually reducing reliance on the legacy systems.27

Multiple core banking systems can present an additional challenge: Which systems should be modernized first, and how? Systems that process high volumes of transactions, like core deposits and credit card platforms, will likely take significant effort to transform versus some lending platforms that might be easier to migrate. Key Bank, for example, chose to modernize its consumer lending platform to provide a better customer experience.28

In contrast, robotic process automation (RPA) and AI in banking are advancing rapidly, with RPA bringing productivity gains and AI enabling intelligent insights on customers, compliance, and operations.

We expect some banks and capital markets firms to begin monetizing their technology expertise as-a-service in 2019, turning cost centers into profit centers. For example, Nasdaq’s SMARTS Market Surveillance solution, used by exchanges and regulators in 65 markets, analyzes traders’ emails and instant messages along with transaction data to ensure market conduct.29,30"
doc22,"Banks Brace for a New Wave of Digital Disruption.
When bank executives experience a moment of worry, it is because of the changing behaviors of their customers, including one from the future whom we call Maximilian.

The year is 2025, and Maximilian is a 35-year-old corporate treasurer in London. In both his personal and business lives, Maximilian operates in a way that betrays no loyalty to the banks he used when he was growing up. He handles all his personal financial needs—paying for his morning coffee, reimbursing a friend for theater tickets, securing a mortgage for the new condo he plans to buy—with services he accesses through his iPhone. Apple may be working with his previous personal bank on the back end, but Maximilian isn’t focused on that and doesn’t need to know the details. He has not stepped into a bank branch in almost a decade.

At work, too, Maximilian’s modus operandi is to look for fast and reliable digital solutions in his area of responsibility—investing his company’s cash overnight and ensuring that the company has enough cash for its daily needs. Maximilian’s employer used to rely on four multinational banks for help with these services, but now Maximilian and the department he runs rely heavily on a digital cash management service that is part of Google’s enterprise offering. The four banks now have nowhere near the same share of the company’s business that they once had. Instead, those fees are, in large part, going to Google and a handful of different banks that have higher rates and better technical integration with Google’s cash management service.

Welcome to a not-so-comforting view of the future. If you are a bank CEO whose job is to figure out where things are headed over the next five to seven years, chances are that scenarios like this enter your mind at least periodically. But maybe they don’t stay in your thoughts for long. After all, the fintech revolution has produced less immediate disruption than had been anticipated, and massive customer defections haven’t materialized.

To some degree, we share the renewed confidence that banking executives are feeling. Indeed, given the fundamental strength of many leading multinational banks, banking’s inherently high barriers to entry, and the extent of the industry’s recovery since the 2008 crisis, we’ve concluded that many traditional banks—far from fading into the background—will actually gain strength in the coming years. But to be among the winners, banks will have to redefine themselves and change how they operate. Anything else would be a mistake.
Breathing a Sigh of Relief

Let’s start with the good news: the banking industry has rebounded since 2008. One clear sign of this is the industry’s revenue growth. By 2022, global bank revenues will have climbed to an estimated $5.4 trillion—some 75% higher than their level in 2011. That includes a revenue pool increase of roughly $1 trillion between now and 2022, according to Boston Consulting Group estimates. Asia-Pacific will have 37% of the banking pools in 2022, by far the largest share of any region in the world. Revenues in North America will also grow, helped by a strong economy. European bank growth will be the weakest. (See Exhibit 1.)

Another positive sign is the rebound in bank profit pools. Returns on equity remain below precrisis levels, but this is mostly because of new regulations and the higher capital requirements they have led to. (See Exhibit 2.)

The businesses that are enjoying this growth in profitability are not, for the most part, in imminent danger from outside attackers. By and large, traditional banks—compared with nonbanks—have held onto their market share. Their customers, in other words, are not going the way of our imaginary Maximilian and switching to new providers. Instead, these customers are inclined—because of the nature of their banking relationships—to trust banks more than nonbanks and remain loyal.

But banks that give in to a renewed feeling of security are flirting with disaster. Bank profits are just too big for today’s digital giants to ignore. Jeff Bezos’s oft-repeated quote “Your margin is my opportunity” may not have been specifically about banking. But the sentiment should not be forgotten.
A Battle Royale Is Taking Shape

To be sure, the most likely scenario for the near term is a ratcheting-up of existing competition between and among full-service banks. The potential for a share shift is greater than ever before, with most of the gains going to banks that lead in scale, customer data, and digital expertise. This includes banks that understand how their customers want to transact banking services in a digital age and banks that jump ahead in areas such as analytics and artificial intelligence (AI).

All of that will pale in comparison with the potential disruption from digital giants. Before long, these companies—already a presence in many other industries—will be beating at the ramparts of banking, too.

The US digital giants with the broadest ambitions in the consumer space (including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft) have largely stopped short of moves that would directly challenge Western banks.

Elsewhere, the presence of digital giants in financial services is further along, sometimes in the form of partnerships with banks. Alibaba has had huge success in payments with Alipay and has leveraged its customer relationships to further expand into lending and money management. ZhongAn and Tencent are developing digital solutions for insurers and banks. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, M-Pesa—set up by Vodafone—has become a widely used everyday payment platform. 

One could make the case that US digital giants—certainly those that have been under siege for their business and privacy practices in the recent past—may prefer, for now, to avoid any new initiatives that could attract government attention or regulatory scrutiny.

However, it’s wishful thinking to expect these companies to lay low indefinitely. This became clear recently when Facebook said it was planning to introduce a new cryptocurrency called Libra. And certainly no one should discount the long-term disruptive threat that the digital giants pose. Facebook, Amazon, and their ilk have great brands, peerless capabilities in analytics and AI, and seemingly infinite quantities of data. There isn’t a bank that knows more than Facebook about people’s social influences or a bank that knows more than Amazon about people’s shopping habits. This information has a richness far beyond that available to banks.

Furthermore, the customer reach of digital giants matches, or exceeds, that of most banks. Alibaba, for instance, has an active customer base that is bigger than China’s largest banks. Amazon has more than 100 million Prime customers in the US, far more customers than even the largest US banks. This scale gives digital giants a significant advantage in customer access and data.
The Imperative: Banks Must Act Quickly

The challenge for banks is analogous to the one that Netflix described a few years ago when it plunged into the business of developing original content. “The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us,” Netflix’s leaders took to saying.

That moment in Netflix’s history has parallels for today’s banking industry. If the digital giants are going to invade the banks’ turf, the banks must start to act more like digital giants. The imperative to do this, of course, will vary by region, largely because of different regulatory protections and levels of consumer sophistication. But almost all banks will need to speed their move into the digital future. If they don’t, they risk being boxed into a set of risky, capital-intensive, and low-return businesses, while digital giants, or more aggressive traditional competitors, snare the most attractive businesses for themselves.

We know that senior management teams at many banks think that they’re already serious about digital transformation. But we are skeptical about how much their initiatives have actually accomplished.

For instance, we have seen some efforts at banks to digitally reimagine certain services, such as the approval of home equity loans and the onboarding of new customers. But these efforts haven’t moved beyond the design phase: they are still conference room discussions built around process maps annotated with yellow stickies. Likewise, we’ve seen more banks moving toward agile ways of working—an approach that should speed up the delivery of new products and services. But the agile efforts at banks are mostly fragmented and experimental: consequently, they have not led to the desired productivity, customer satisfaction, or efficiency gains.

Similarly, few traditional banks have turned data, analytics, and AI into priorities, and even fewer have integrated these capabilities into their core processes. Also, it is the rare bank that has come up with distinctive value propositions to attract top engineers, data scientists, and user experience designers.

The still-preliminary nature of these initiatives leaves many attractive parts of banks’ businesses fragmented and vulnerable, including retail and small business deposits, payments, and wealth management. These are areas in which digital giants’ brands, customer bases and data, and technological sophistication give them significant advantages. (See Exhibit 3.)
The Elements of a Holistic Digital Transformation

Instead of isolated efforts, traditional banks need a holistic digital transformation. Such a transformation is a good strategy—both offensive and defensive—no matter what happens between now and 2025. Even if forays by digital giants don’t materialize by 2025, or if they affect only certain product lines, a bank that has undergone a holistic transformation and remade itself for a digital age will be well positioned to increase its market share, revenues, and profitability—as well as to deliver superior returns to shareholders. Meanwhile, if disruption from digital giants does materialize in the form of a frontal assault, a bank that has undergone digital transformation will be less vulnerable.

The impetus for this transformation must come from the top. The CEO needs to establish a few big goals to guide the company’s digital investments and activities—and use the bully pulpit to put an end to incremental thinking. The stretch goal might be to increase digital sales or lower the cost-income ratio within five years to a percentage that seems inconceivable today. It might be to fully digitize the bank’s 100 most common back-office transactions so that by 2025, there is no such thing as executing them manually. The goal could be to use digital innovations to push customer satisfaction to levels the bank has never achieved before. Each of these objectives would require large-scale changes and would yield measurable results.

A holistic digital transformation will require coordinated efforts across multiple, interlinked elements.

Drive to scale. Scale—sheer size—which allows for operating at lower unit costs, has always been a source of competitive advantage for banks. Today, however, scale is more important than ever before: it gives banks a much greater ability to invest in marketing and technology, and, perhaps most critically, scale today means larger customer bases and more data. These are huge sources of advantage. In explaining their plan to merge earlier this year, two regional US banks, BB&T and SunTrust Banks, acknowledged the importance of scale in a digital-first world. “We will be able to leverage our scale to create capacity for incremental investments and technology,” BB&T chief executive Kelly King told analysts when the deal was announced. “We’ve talked about ‘disrupt to thrive,’ and this is it.”

Of course, there are ways other than M&A for banks to achieve scale, including by becoming more focused in their portfolios—a strategy that might involve divesting low-return businesses—and by pursuing partnerships.

Digitize end-to-end customer journeys. Banking products and services are notoriously friction filled and tedious, entangling customers in the machinery of the banks’ legal and risk policies, P&L structures, and legacy IT systems. Yes, most banks have started to map customer journeys end-to-end, precisely to eliminate these pain points. This theoretically straightforward exercise almost invariably runs smack into the reality of bank operating models, processes, and product silos.

Take, for example, the experience of many wholesale-banking customers. In many cases, the know-your-customer and account-opening processes of the onboarding phase take days or even weeks instead of being largely automated tasks that take minutes. For hundreds of relatively simple servicing interactions, customers still need to call their bankers because the institution hasn’t provided self-service procedures. For credit transactions, it’s not unusual for a banker to have to complete long credit memos while the customer is required to search for evidence of company ownership, income, and assets and liabilities, and to wait for credit check results—all information that is in the bank’s own databases or the public domain. Weeks into the process, the banker may be forced to ask the customer for additional “missing” information or, worse, to decline the credit with an inadequate explanation.

Transformation of the wholesale-banking customer journey—the redesign of transactions to reduce the time they require and irritation they cause—will require banks to have a handle on their existing and public client information, embrace radical process and policy simplification, move to simple product designs, and automate aspects of their credit decisions, document management processes, and workflows. (The same requirements apply to banks transforming the journeys of retail customers.) Banks will be forced to do a better job of internal coordination and to set targets that apply across functions, including distribution, technology, credit, risk, legal, compliance, operations, and digital.

Leverage big data, analytics, and AI. This is the Holy Grail—the use of data and analytics to make banking easier and more personalized for customers and more profitable for banks. When combined with big data, AI can, much earlier than traditional methods, help banks identify customers who might leave for another bank—in many cases, they can do this before the customer even realizes that he or she is dissatisfied. The combination of big data and AI helps banks improve their service at the individual-customer level, whether by recommending a more economical way of handling a transaction—perhaps through self-service—or offering to automate a recurring task, such as a monthly transfer to a parent or child.

These examples of data and analytics that allow banks to anticipate the needs of their customers are part of a paradigm shift: retail banks, in particular, instead of merely responding to their customers’ needs, are starting to “think” and deliver “nudges” to help customers achieve their goals. These more frequent interactions, if they reflect guidance that a customer considers valuable, have the benefit of increasing that customer’s trust in the bank.

Pursue partnerships to increase capabilities and scale. For the things they cannot do well on their own, banks must develop a partnership strategy. Many banks have already entered into partnerships with fintechs, generally by making minority investments. However, the strategic rationale for these investments isn’t always clear. A partnership that lacks a clear purpose, the potential for capability enhancement, and a genuine prospect of helping one of a bank’s core businesses is not a partnership worth entering in the first place.

One possibility is to partner with one or another of the digital giants directly. This may seem like a risky move, and it would take some pretty special circumstances for such a partnership to make sense, but digital giants have intensely loyal customer bases, great technology, and massive distribution potential. For a bank with a unique attribute or capability that a digital giant might covet, there could be a negotiation of peers—and a successful partnership.

Adopt new ways of working. Most banks haven’t fundamentally changed the way they approach their work in decades. This is certainly true in software development, and sequential “waterfall” methods, misalignment of business and technology organizations, and emphasis on product features over customer benefits often produce disappointing results. Banks need to rethink this aspect of their work. In particular, they would do well to move to agile approaches.

Pioneered by technology companies as a software development method—Spotify, Google, and Netflix do pretty much all their work through agile teams—agile ways of working are now increasingly common at traditional companies. Several global banks, in fact, treat agile as the default operating mode in their product development, digital, data and analytics, and IT departments. For that matter, there is no reason why agile methodologies must be limited to technology work. Agile can also increase the effectiveness of nontechnology departments, including marketing, human resources, and finance.

ING Group, based in the Netherlands, provides an example of a bank that conducted an agile transformation early on. ING has frankly said that it is following the example of digital giants, changing its people practices, rethinking its funding model, streamlining its decision-making processes, and introducing new technology. The impact of ING’s transformation is evident in the bank’s results, which include dozens—instead of just a handful—of new product and service releases annually, a significant increase in IT efficiency and capacity and in employee engagement.

Attract and retain digital talent. Even the largest banks with the most ample resources have struggled to recruit and retain the talent they need to compete in a digital age. There simply aren’t enough software engineers to fill the jobs that are available in all industries globally, and generally, banks are not the first places where highly trained tech workers look for jobs. Moreover, the sort of digital transformation we’re talking about requires highly trained people with specialized expertise: data scientists who can coax value from information, enterprise architects who can help with new decisions involving platforms, and engineers who can solve business problems through technology and smooth delivery processes.

Some IT workers currently working in banks may be able to develop these skills through dedicated training and coaching. But this is also an area in which it will make sense to partner with, or even acquire, high-caliber fintechs or boutique engineering firms. The challenge is to find a structure for these partnerships that will create a compelling value proposition so that the new contributors are motivated not just to stay but also to do their best work.

Simplify technology and data infrastructure. Having the right technology and data infrastructure is a prerequisite to digital transformation. To provide the digital experience customers expect, banks will have to aggressively adopt the technology paradigms of digitally native companies. This can happen only if banks drop the vertically integrated legacy technology stacks they’re using today and opt for horizontally layered, platform-based technologies.

As part of this change, banks should adopt virtual private clouds, move toward a service orientation (by using containers, microservices, and other frameworks), decouple business logic from data (including through service tiers), and merge operational and analytical data storage (through DaaS, or Data as a Service). All of these moves can help banks position themselves to deliver products and capabilities much faster than they do today. These moves will also lead to a change in the CIO’s fundamental role: from serving the line of business to providing a platform.

Ensure cybersecurity resilience. This is a condition not only for succeeding in a digital age but also for having a chance of surviving it. All of the good things that banks are trying to do with the help of digital technology—create step changes in convenience, turn their customers into advocates, and operate more efficiently—can be undone by security breaches. A best practice for banks’ chief risk officers (CROs) is to form strategic partnerships with promising fintechs, “risktechs,” and cloud service providers that provide needed talent and speed important innovation. Indeed, some bank CROs—looking at the strides that cloud service providers have made in cybersecurity—already believe that their best bet for avoiding breaches will be to use such outside service providers for their most critical data and processing.
Now Is the Time

Many bank CEOs, in a discussion of digital initiatives that are starting to reshape the industry, initially respond, “I know. We already have projects going in those areas.” It’s when they more closely assess their situation that they realize the limited scope and value of what they’re doing. A lot of the AI initiatives at banks, for example, are experiments that haven’t yet had direct impact on the customer experience. Many of the agile teams are only in banks’ IT groups; they aren’t in the functions responsible for customer-facing services. Incrementalism is standard, and this becomes clear when companies benchmark themselves along the eight digital transformation elements. (See Exhibit 4.)

We understand why many banks have settled into incremental approaches to digitization. A decade after the financial crisis ran its course, many banks believe that their fundamental value proposition is intact. Bank leaders know that digital technology and changing customer behaviors will take the industry in new directions. However, many of them no longer think that disintermediation is likely in the near term. They expect an inflection point that will signal it’s time to move quicker.

The inflection point is, however, already here, and the relatively calm waters in which banks find themselves a decade after the 2008 storm are deceptive. It’s easy to ignore a new wave of disruption forming at a distance but impossible to navigate through it once it is upon you. Banks that are not preparing now will pay a price later on."
doc23,"On October 30, South Korea’s main financial authority officially cleared banks to work with crypto exchanges for the first time in history, establishing a major milestone for the local cryptocurrency sector.

At the state affairs audit, held by both government parties of South Korea to evaluate and track the progress of every government branch and agency under the administration of President Moon Jae-in, Financial Services Commission (FSC) commissioner, Choi Jong-ku, stated that the FSC has cleared banks to work with cryptocurrency exchanges by providing virtual bank accounts.

On the digital asset trading platforms of South Korea, every bank account holder is provided with a virtual bank account by the account issuer, in this case a local bank, to provide an instantaneous and efficient system to withdraw and deposit funds.

Cryptocurrency investors in South Korea are not required to wait one to five days for deposits and withdrawals to clear, as they can safely store the South Korean won on exchanges by leveraging the security of local banks.

Commissioner Choi stated that banks and financial institutions are authorized to provide virtual bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges, given that the exchanges have strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems in place that do not allow anonymous accounts and users to trade digital assets.

    “There exists no issue in banks providing virtual bank accounts to cryptocurrency exchanges. If digital asset trading platforms have KYC and AML systems in place, there is no problem in issuing virtual bank accounts to exchanges.”

The approval of banks by the FSC, to open virtual accounts for cryptocurrency investors, is not equivalent to the approval of anonymous accounts. Virtual bank accounts in South Korea refer to replica accounts of bank holders, provided to third party platforms like cryptocurrency exchanges to allow instantaneous deposits and withdrawals.
Major milestone for South Korea and local exchanges

Throughout the past five years, despite the increase in demand for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the government of South Korea has been skeptical towards regulating the asset class and the market because it feared that the implementation of a regulatory framework would come across as an endorsement of the asset class to the public.

However, the abrupt increase in the valuation of the cryptocurrency market in late 2017, which saw the price of Bitcoin skyrocket from $5,000 to $20,000, and briefly reach $25,000 in South Korea due to the so-called “Kimchi Premium” that refers to premium rates on major cryptocurrencies, encouraged the government to strictly regulate the market and demand local cryptocurrency exchanges to enable investor protection.

In June, Kim Yong-bum, the vice chairman of the FSC, officially declared that the Kimchi Premium in the cryptocurrency exchangemarket of South Korea has dematerialized, eliminating the possibility of investors overseas, to take advantage of the premium and arbitrage.

    “The government’s practical policies led the ‘Kimchi Premium’ to disappear in South Korea. At its peak, the ‘Kimchi Premium’ in the local cryptocurrency exchange market reached 50 percent, due to unusual spike in demand and speculation. As of current, the price of cryptocurrencies is nearly identical to other markets, demonstrating stability in the South Korean cryptocurrency market.”

At the time, the FSC had taken its first approach towards regulating the market to prioritize investor protection. Seeing some progress in its efforts, the FSC and the rest of the local financial authorities in South Korea continued to regulate the space. In hindsight, the formation of the Kimchi Premium and the lack of investor protection in the cryptocurrency market throughout late 2017 and early 2018 led the government to properly regulate the market.

The latest decision of the FSC to clear banks to cooperate with crypto exchanges represent the willingness of the government to legitimize the market, reflecting the government’s previous plans released in July, to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges as proper financial institutions.

All of the major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea including Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit, the top four trading platforms in terms of daily trading volume, and every other minor cryptocurrency exchange will be entitled to fair banking service moving forward, as legitimate financial businesses.

Banks will not be able to reject crypto exchanges for any reason other than money laundering. As long as cryptocurrency exchanges are compliant with local KYC and AML regulations, then banks are not permitted to refrain from providing banking services to trading platforms.
South Korea’s court sides with crypto exchange in dispute with bank

On October 30, the Seoul Central District Court ruled on a case between a cryptocurrency exchange and a major bank in favor the exchange, further solidifying and strengthening the right of digital asset trading platforms to obtain fair, transparent, and stable banking services from local financial institutions.

On the same day FSC chairman Choi officially approved banks to work with crypto exchanges, the Seoul Central District Court released its decision on a court case between local cryptocurrency exchange, Coinis, and major commercial bank, Nonghyup.

In early September, Coinis filed a complaint in court after Nonghyup unilaterally ended its banking services to the exchange. Kim Tae-rim, a Seoul-based attorney who represented Coinis, claimed that Nonghyup had no right to abruptly end its services to the exchange.

Although Nonghyup responded that it had followed the guideline of the FSC, in lawfully rejecting to provide services to the exchange, the court sided with Coinis and requested the bank to resume services to the platform.

Attorney Kim stated that the case is a historic achievement for the cryptocurrency sector, as it will establish a precedent in the long-term and will discourage banks from unilaterally refusing to provide services to digital asset exchanges.

    “Cryptocurrency exchanges, by default, have the right to freely deposit and withdraw funds to and from major banks in South Korea, and an abrupt termination of partnership and services by the bank [in this case Nonghyup] without sufficient evidence or reasoning falls under the breach of contract.”

For eight months, since January, Nonghyup also refused to provide services to Bithumb, which disallowed the largest exchange in South Korea from registering new users.

Image taken from CoinCap.io, top five exchanges in the crypto market

The renewal of the contract between Nonghyup and Bithumb came about after the exchange overhauled its security and internal management systems, subsequent to suffering two consecutive hacking attacks.

But, given the timing of the contract renewal, it is possible that the bank was anticipating the stance of the FSC prior to publicly announcing its deal with Bithumb. A Bithumb representative said at the time:

    “Bithumb is now able to issue virtual bank accounts for new users after a partnership has been established with NH Bank. Bithumb will continue to comply with the bank’s guideline strictly while cooperating with the government to create a transparent and robust market for local investors.”

Throughout the years to come, exchanges that are approved by the FSC and local financial authorities, will face no issues in receiving bank support from every major bank in the country.
Chairman of Korea’s National Policy Committee calls for proper crypto adoption

On October 2, Min Byung-du, the chairman of Korea’s National Policy Committee, called for a proper adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, encouraging the government to end its cautious approach towards regulating the space.

Chairman Min specifically addressed the imposition of a blanket ban on domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs) and firmly stated that the government has to embrace the rapidly growing market with practical, positive, and efficient regulatory frameworks that can facilitate the growth of the local sector.

Under the premise that money laundering, extreme speculation, and fraudulent operations are prevented with necessary regulation, chairman Min emphasized that the government should allow ICOs and other cryptocurrency-related activities.

    “Regulation is not bad. Regulation is necessary, it is the only way to legitimize the market and allow investors to build trust towards the cryptocurrency market. The government cannot dismiss ICO. It needs to allow companies to conduct ICO. ICO has become a new trend in the global market and it is the responsibility and ability of the government to embrace new technologies. We can see that the flow of investment is clearly changing compared to ICO and angel fundraising. The ICO has raised $1.7 billion for Telegram and $4 billion for Block.One, It is getting bigger and bigger.”

During his speech delivered to the Congress, chairman Min referred to ICOs as a primary example of innovation related to the fourth industrial revolution that is currently blocked out by the government. But, Min also added that other potential technologies and activities related to the asset class and the crypto sector have to be allowed for the country to remain at the forefront of blockchain technology development.
Legalizing ICOs

Perhaps influenced by the call of chairman Min, local publications have reported that the government is planning to allow domestic ICOs by the end of the year.

In January, a spokesperson of a cryptocurrency task force, established by the government of South Korea, told mainstream media outlet, Chosun, that the government was planning to allow institutional investors to invest in domestic ICOs. However, the report was met with fierce criticism and outrage from local investors.

    “Currently, the task force is considering imposing stricter regulations for investor and consumer protection within the cryptocurrency market.” The spokesperson added “in regards to ICOs, the government will likely impose regulations to enable institutional investors to invest in ICOs.”

While Cointelegraph reported that FSC commissioner Choi expressed a negative stance towards the unregulated nature of ICOs, on October 26, Ministry of Science and ICT minister, Yoo Young-min, said the ministry is exploring the legalization of ICOs.

According to a local publication, a key government official explained that it is difficult to ban investors from participating in ICOs because they are conducted in a peer-to-peer manner using Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The official stated that it is better for the government to provide clarity, regulation, and taxation policy to regulate the space with sufficient investor protection.

    “It is realistically difficult to outright ban ICOs. Given that it is challenging for local financial authorities to impose a blanket ban on ICOs, the government is currently favoring several policies like restrictive access to ICOs or strengthened regulation on ICOs as alternative solutions.”

Already, several regions in South Korea, such as the country’s two largest cities Seoul and Busan, have disclosed their plans to legalize ICOs in the upcoming months.

Jeju Island, which operates as an independent state that is permitted to have its own laws outside of federal laws, has also released its plans to adopt cryptocurrencies and legalize ICOs. Jeju Island is also currently finalizing its plans to create a special zone for global blockchain and cryptocurrencies that will operate as a crypto hub within the country.
Aspects of the local market that need improvement

On September 11, South Korea’s venture enterprise division formally decided to eliminate cryptocurrency exchanges from the newly drafted and proposed venture bill that provides small to medium-size companies with a variety of benefits including tax and investment merits.

The rationale of the venture enterprise division for eliminating digital asset trading platforms was its acknowledgement of cryptocurrency trading as gambling, which contradicts the government’s stance towards cryptocurrency exchanges and the recently released statement of FSC commissioner Choi.

Local exchanges, investors, and the South Korea Blockchain Association requested for clarity from the government regarding the questionable decision of the venture enterprise division that went against all of the positive efforts the government has demonstrated over the past eleven months to regulate the space.

    “We cannot understand the government’s stance on cryptocurrency regulations, and it is completely illogical for the government to leave a rapidly growing industry out of a major bill like this,” an exchange operator who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, said.

The FSC also recently warned investors against cryptocurrency hedge funds, claiming that many public funds fail to represent legal investing tools that comply with South Korea’s Capital Markets Act.

Overall, the cryptocurrency market of South Korea remains highly positive in regards to the decision of the FSC to allow banks to work with crypto exchanges and issue virtual bank accounts to trading platforms without the risk of unilateral termination of service.

Over the months to come, the government is expected to work with the South Korea Blockchain Association, to strengthen KYC and AML systems employed by cryptocurrency exchanges and to implement sophisticated transaction monitoring systems to eliminate money laundering.

What is the general state of fintech innovation in your jurisdiction?

Korea has a wide array of fintech businesses from payment services, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and investment, to blockchain applications. The most notable fintech innovation trends are electronic payment services led by major Korean IT companies and financial institutions. These new electronic payment services, such as KakaoPay and NaverPay, are tailored to Korean consumers and are generally well accepted in Korea. New internet-only banking platforms, such as K-Bank and Kakao Bank, have flourished in Korea. These internet-only banks were developed by major Korean IT companies and financial institutions, or through a consortium of major IT companies and financial institutions. These internet-only banks launched their operations in 2017, and secured a sizeable market share of customers by marketing loans with low interest rates or bank deposits with favourable interest rates.

In January 2019, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced this year’s plan to revitalise the fintech industry. The key features of the plan include:

    preliminary application and screening procedures for early settlement of financial regulation sandboxes;
    reform of the existing laws and ‘shadow’ regulations;
    legislation of financial innovation projects such as big data and P2P; and
    establishment of fintech budget execution plans and budget standards.

The financial regulation sandbox is a system that exempts or suspends existing regulations for a certain period of time for innovative financial services that can enhance the financial industry’s competitiveness and consumer benefits pursuant to the Special Act on Support for Financial Innovation that took effect on 1 April 2019. The FSC implemented a preliminary application and review process for innovative financial services to facilitate an early settlement of financial regulatory sandboxes even before the Act was enforced, and has designated a total of 37 innovative financial services over four occasions to date after the Act was implemented.

The FSC has been considering the improvement of regulations under the jurisdiction of all ministries since October 2018 in order to streamline existing regulations, including shadow regulations and other pre-existing ones that hinder the revitalisation of the fintech industry. Major improvements include revitalising non-face-to-face financial transactions and reducing restrictions on a financial company’s investment in fintech firms.

Amendments to the Credit Information Act are being proposed to invigorate the data economy, and legislation is being actively implemented to promote a sound development of the fintech industry.

The FSC has confirmed 7.9 billion won as a new budget for 2019 under a plan to provide up to 75 per cent of R&D costs (up to 100 million won) to fintech firms that participate in financial regulatory testbeds. At the time of the first round of applications, the Commission provided 340 million won to eight companies, and the Commission will receive four applications a year and will financially support about 80 fintech companies.
Government and regulatory support

Do government bodies or regulators provide any support specific to financial innovation? If so, what are the key benefits of such support?

Financial regulators and policymakers in Korea are generally receptive to fintech innovations and technology-driven new entrants to regulated financial services markets in Korea.

The Korean government enacted the Special Act on Support of Innovation of Finance (the Special Act) to revitalise innovative financial services and it has been in effect since 1 April 2019. The key features of the Special Act include designation of innovative financial service (Sandbox), expedited confirmation on regulation and designation of an authorised agent:

    Designation of innovative financial service: a financial service that is designated as an ‘innovative financial service’ by the government may be performed without any regulatory oversight during a certain designated period. Financial service providers whose service can be clearly distinguished from pre-existing services, in terms of contents and methods, may apply to the government to designate such service as an innovative financial service. In addition, if a designated innovative financial service is being operated under a licence required by other financial laws and regulations, such designated innovative financial service will be afforded an exclusive right of operation for two years after being designated as an innovative financial service. This means that during the two-year period granted by the Korean government, no other service provider may provide the same type of financial service in Korea. Up to June 2019, 37 cases of innovative financial services have been designated, including loan comparison platform, drive-through exchange services, data-based credit rating system such as telecommunications information or the company’s tax information.
    Expedited confirmation on regulation: a financial company that plans to start a new type of financial business may consider that no regulation on such new business exists if such company does not receive any response from the FSC within 30 days after its filing of an inquiry to the FSC as of the existence of such regulation. The FSC may forward the inquiry to other relevant government agencies, if deemed necessary, but in any case the FSC must provide a response within 30 days.
    Designation of an authorised agent: in Korea, any essential work of a financial company may not be delegated to a third party, but those who are recognised as designated agents under the Special Act may carry out such essential work of a financial company upon delegation.

Financial regulation
Regulatory bodies

Which bodies regulate the provision of fintech products and services?

The FSC, the decision-making body that oversees policies on financial institutions, and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), the financial watchdog that supervises and inspects financial companies, are in charge of regulation in the fintech sector.
Regulated activities

Which activities trigger a licensing requirement in your jurisdiction?

No entity may engage in a ‘financial investment business’ (a defined term under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act (FSCMA), the primary capital markets law in Korea), which encompasses such activities as underwriting and the brokerage and dealing of securities or derivatives, without obtaining the requisite business licence from or being registered with, and subjecting itself to ongoing supervision by, the FSC under article 11 of the FSCMA. Generally, an investment dealing or brokerage licence is required in order to market, offer, sell or broker a financial investment product to Korean residents. Under the FSCMA, a product for which an investor is at risk of losing any portion of the principal amount invested therein would be treated as a financial investment product, which consists of securities and derivatives.

Without obtaining a banking licence pursuant to the Bank Act, a person cannot engage in banking business, including, among others, deposit taking, lending, guarantees and acquisition of notes, providing mutual instalment arrangements, and packaging or reselling commercial or trade notes under article 8 of the Bank Act.

To conduct foreign exchange business an entity must register with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance pursuant to the Foreign Exchange Transaction Law. Also, an approval from the FSC is required to engage in credit card business, which is regulated by the Credit Specialised Financial Business Act.

Various types of electronic financial business activities would trigger licensing or registration requirements under the Electronic Financial Transactions Act (EFTA), including electronic money, payment services, prepaid electronic payment means and debit cards, among others.
Consumer lending

Is consumer lending regulated in your jurisdiction?

The Money Lending Business Registration and Consumer Protection Act (the Lending Business Act) applies to commercial lending transactions with borrowers domiciled in Korea. In general, the Korean loan market could be largely divided into lending by credit financial companies and lending by moneylenders. Credit financial companies, such as a bank or a credit speciality business with the requisite licence or registration, are not subject to separate registration under the Lending Business Act for lending or loan brokerage business. However, persons without a banking licence or other registration that engage in the lending business, the business of acquiring claims arising from loan agreements and collecting them, or the loan brokerage business in Korea must register as a moneylending business or loan-brokerage business pursuant to the Lending Business Act.

For loans provided by credit financial companies and moneylenders, the maximum interest rate is limited by the Lending Business Act, and for all other entities, the maximum interest rate is regulated pursuant to the Regulation of Interest Act. The maximum interest rate is frequently revised depending on various factors, such as the domestic economic situation. The maximum interest rate currently used for each regulations stands at 24 per cent per year. Interest rate that exceeds the maximum interest rate is nullified pursuant to the applicable laws.
Secondary market loan trading

Are there restrictions on trading loans in the secondary market in your jurisdiction?

Under the Lending Business Act, neither moneylenders nor credit financial institutions may transfer any loan claim to any person other than a credit financial institution, an entity registered for loan collection business, the Korea Housing Finance Corporation, or National Agricultural Cooperative Federation Asset Management Company. Any person who violates this provision shall be subject to criminal punishment (imprisonment of up to three years or a fine of up to 30 million won).
Collective investment schemes

Describe the regulatory regime for collective investment schemes and whether fintech companies providing alternative finance products or services would fall within its scope.

The FSCMA defines a ‘collective investment’ scheme as an arrangement where a ‘collective investment vehicle’ pools funds from more than two investors, manages such funds at its discretion and distributes the earnings from such management to the investors.

Fintech companies are regulated completely separately from collective investment business entities under the FSCMA. P2P lenders are regulated as online loan information brokers (P2P platform businesses) and online loan information related credit service providers (credit service businesses) under the Act on Credit Business, and crowdfunding platforms are regulated as online small investment brokers under the FSCMA.
Alternative investment funds

Are managers of alternative investment funds regulated?

Under the FSCMA, collective investment vehicles (ie, funds) are generally categorised as either public or private funds. Private funds are further categorised as either a hedge fund or a private equity fund (PEF) depending on the investment strategy. Only licensed investment managers are permitted to set up and manage public funds or hedge funds.

On the other hand, a Korean PEF is required to be established as a hapja-hoesa (which is similar to a limited partnership) that is composed of members with limited liability and is managed by a general partner (GP). The GP of a PEF must be registered with the FSC in order to be able to set up a Korean PEF.

While the meaning of an ‘alternative investment fund’ can be quite broad, assuming that such fund is privately offered to a limited number of investors and its investment strategy is not limited to only private equity investments, such fund would be categorised as a hedge fund. In this regard, fintech companies wishing to manage Korean alternative investment funds should first obtain the required licence from the FSC, which is available only to a Korean-domiciled company.
Peer-to-peer and marketplace lending

Describe any specific regulation of peer-to-peer or marketplace lending in your jurisdiction.

Owing to a sharp increase in P2P borrowing in Korea, the Korean financial regulatory authorities published the P2P Loan Guidelines in February 2017, which became effective as of 29 May 2017.

For ordinary individual investors who are P2P lenders, the P2P Loan Guidelines set a monetary limit of between 5 million and 40 million won, which varies depending on the income of the investor. But the P2P Loan Guidelines do not set a monetary limit for P2P lenders who are either corporate investors or individual expert investors. There is no loan amount limit for borrowers in P2P lending under the P2P Loan Guidelines. The P2P Loan Guidelines require segregation of the investment funds of investors from the proprietary assets of the P2P business.

The P2P Loan Guidelines are administrative guidances of the FSS and are not legally binding. However, financial regulators plan to monitor the compliance by financial companies that are partners of the P2P companies with the P2P Loan Guidelines and take corrective measures if necessary.
Crowdfunding

Describe any specific regulation of crowdfunding in your jurisdiction.

The FSCMA was amended as of 25 January 2016 to legalise equity crowdfunding. This new legal framework requires that a company that wishes to conduct crowdfunding business in Korea must be registered as a small online investment broker with the FSC.

Such small online investment brokers can issue debt securities, equity securities or investment contract securities so long as they allow the exchange of comments between small online securities issuers (those in need of funds) and investors (fund suppliers) and among investors through websites (including other similar means such as mobile applications and virtual spaces).

There are, however, certain restrictions on the issuance of equity for crowdfunding under the FSCMA. For instance, a single company can raise funds of up to 1.5 billion won per year through crowdfunding. To raise funds exceeding 1.5 billion won, conventional means of financing should be used. Moreover, under the FSCMA, the issuance of equity for crowdfunding is permitted for non-listed small to medium-sized companies with fewer than seven years of business operations.

In April 2018, the Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA was amended to increase the limit for an ordinary investor to invest in crowdfunding from 5 million to 10 million won per year with an issuer of equity. In addition, the amended Enforcement Decree of the FSCMA allowed ‘social enterprises’, which are companies certified by the Ministry of Employment and Labour that seek to improve financial, social and environmental well-being through commercial activities (eg, providing employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups or making contributions to the local society) to raise funds through crowdfunding.

Reward-based crowdfunding business entities may give out in-kind rewards by being registered as mail order distributors under the Act on Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce.

There are no laws or regulations that specifically regulate ­donation-based crowdfunding businesses.
Invoice trading

Describe any specific regulation of invoice trading in your jurisdiction.

There is no specific regulation of invoice trading since invoice trading is not deemed to be moneylending business. However, if a trans­action constitutes a secured loan transaction having an invoice loan as collateral (even if the transaction takes the form of invoice trading), such transaction would be deemed as moneylending business, which requires a licence if the party is not a credit financial institution.
Payment services

Are payment services regulated in your jurisdiction?

Yes. Payment services are regulated under the EFTA, and are subject to registration requirements and other obligations under the EFTA.

In order to run a payment service, registration needs to be made as a payment gateway (PG) with the FSC. Upon registering as a PG, obligations under the EFTA are applied, and the PG is subject to supervision and inspection by the FSS.
Open banking

Are there any laws or regulations introduced to promote competition that require financial institutions to make customer or product data available to third parties?

Local financial institutions are subject to periodic (quarterly and monthly) business reporting requirements. Such business reports are submitted to the FSC, but financial institutions are required to publicly disclose a summary of such report. Laws and regulations that apply to the disclosure of each financial institution vary, but financial institutions are generally not required to publicly disclose specific customer or product data.

Under the Credit Information Act, financial institutions are permitted to share their customer information via a centralised credit information collection agency approved by the FSC, Korea Credit Information Services. Such sharing of customer data is for the common benefit of financial institutions to manage the customer credit risk.

Sector-specific laws and regulations generally require the relevant financial institution to disclose product data. For instance, brokers and dealers are required to disclose their fees for specific products, and asset managers are required to disclose certain fund information through the industry association’s (the Korea Financial Investment Association) website.

Meanwhile, the FSC has announced its plan to introduce ‘own credit information management businesses’ (known as My Data) through amendment of the Electronic Financial Transactions Act in order to foster industries for promotion of data payments and to innovate data usage-related regulations. My Data businesses are businesses that provide professional support for the individual that is the information principal to efficiently manage and use his or her own information. My Data businesses integrate and search one’s credit information, analyse financial statuses and provide personalised financial consulting. Furthermore, My Data businesses can provide services that present a list of accessible financial products for each individual consumer given his or her credit situation, financial status, etc, and compare in detail prices and benefits of each product to recommend financial products optimised for each individual.
Insurance products

Do fintech companies that sell or market insurance products in your jurisdiction need to be regulated?

Under article 83 of the Insurance Business Act, if a person wishes to solicit or market insurance or reinsurance products, it must register as one of the following:

    an insurance solicitor (the person must meet certain registration requirements, such as the completion of training sessions held by an appropriate insurance association);
    an insurance agent (the person must meet certain registration requirements, such as the completion of training sessions held by the Korea Insurance Institute); or
    an insurance broker (the person must pass the insurance broker examination and register him or herself with the FSS).

Credit references

Are there any restrictions on providing credit references or credit information services in your jurisdiction?

The Credit Information Use And Protection Act (the Credit Information Act) prohibits engaging in credit information business without obtaining the appropriate licence from the FSC. The Credit Information Law limits those who may be licensed to an entity at least half of whose capital is invested by financial institutions and an entity at least half of whose capital is invested by the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund, the Korea Technology Finance Corporation, a credit guarantee foundation, the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation, or a person who is licensed to engage in credit information business.

Cross-border regulation
Passporting

Can regulated activities be passported into your jurisdiction?

Regulated activities cannot be passported into Korea.
Requirement for a local presence

Can fintech companies obtain a licence to provide financial services in your jurisdiction without establishing a local presence?

In general, licences and registration for financial services are available only to Korean companies or branches, with limited exceptions. For example, a local presence is not required for a foreign investment advisory business entity or a foreign discretionary investment business entity, if such business entity runs its business directly for Korean residents in a foreign country or runs investment advisory business or discretionary investment business via any means of telecommunication.

Where a fintech business established out of Korea wishes to access new customers in Korea, it will need to consider whether it is required to be authorised by a Korean regulatory authority. A fintech business established outside of Korea may be subject to Korean laws and regulations if it carries out regulated activities in Korea. Where an overseas fintech business performs regulated activities in Korea, it will need to obtain authorisation from the relevant Korean financial regulatory authority. Generally, the standard to determine the applicability of Korean laws to foreign fintech businesses is whether the foreign fintech businesses targeted Korean customers (eg, Korean website) or allowed payment in Korean won.

Sales and marketing
Restrictions

What restrictions apply to the sales and marketing of financial services and products in your jurisdiction?

The FSCMA generally prohibits advertising for any business run by a financial investment business or for any financial investment instrument other than a financial investment business. A financial investment business must include its name, the descriptions of financial investment instruments, the risks contingent upon the investment, etc, when advertising for investments. The FSCMA also provides that online small investment brokers and online small securities issuers cannot advertise for investment through any means other than the website opened by the online small investment brokers.

Further, as general legislation on advertising, the Act on Fair Labelling and Advertising prohibits any of the following labelling or advertising that is likely to undermine fair trade order by deceiving or misleading consumers, or compel other business entities to do so:

    false or exaggerated labelling or advertising;
    deceptive labelling or advertising;
    unfairly comparative labelling or advertising; or
    slanderous labelling or advertising.

In the event the Fair Trade Commission has justifiable grounds to conduct an ex officio investigation suggesting that a financial entity has violated the above, it will notify the FSC, and the FSC will lead the investigation.

Change of control
Notification and consent

Describe any rules relating to notification or consent requirements if a regulated business changes control.

In cases where the major shareholder of a financial company is changed, the entity to be the major shareholder is in principle required to obtain the approval from the FSC by satisfying the different requirements prescribed by the Enforcement Decree of the Act on Corporate Governance of Financial Companies, depending on whether it is a financial institution, a fund, other domestic entity, an individual or a foreign entity. However, the reporting procedures are separately prescribed for a bank, a bank’s holding company, a mutual savings bank, an investment advisory company and discretionary investment company, a facility lease company, an instalment financing company, and a new technology financing company by individual laws. Under the Banking Act and the Financial Holding Companies Act:

    in the case of a bank and a bank’s financial holding company, a single person’s shareholding ratio will be limited, and it may hold shares to the extent approved by the FSC;
    in the case of a mutual savings bank, if it is merged, it shall be approved by the FSC, and if the largest shareholder is changed or the shares held by a large shareholder or its related party is changed by 1/100th of the total issued shares with voting rights, it shall report such change to the FSC;
    in the case of an investment advisory company and discretionary investment company, if a merger, etc takes place similarly with a mutual savings bank, it shall be approved by the FSC and if the largest shareholder is changed or the shares held by the large shareholder or its related party are changed by 1/100th of the total issued shares with voting rights, it shall report such change to the FSC; and
    in the case of a facility lease company, an instalment financing company and a new technology financing company, if the largest shareholder is changed or the shares held by a major shareholder or its related party are changed by 1/100th of the total issued shares with voting right, it shall report such changes to the FSC.

doc25,"A NEW LANDSCAPE FOR RETAIL BANKING 
 

 

Key Takeaways:

 

    The rise of virtual banking across APAC has redefined the way retail banking operations flow, affecting their real estate portfolios and space optimization
    But, we don’t expect to see virtual banking as a replica for retail banking. Retail banking will evolve to serve different parts of the market
    Overall – a new banking landscape is ahead of us and operators who can optimize different bank formats will remain competitive

 

The transformation of retail is underway in Asia Pacific. With data-driven insights in their artillery, retailers have sought to reshape the shopping experience through personalization and placemaking. Likewise, the retail banking industry has also embarked upon a journey of reconfiguring branches into experiential hubs. The emergence of virtual banking has sparked a makeover in retail banking outlets, which now serve a larger purpose of enhancing customer relationships and brand identity. Naturally, this has led to a reengineering of retail banks’ real estate portfolios and space utilization.

 

THE EXPANDING REALM OF VIRTUAL BANKING

 

The virtual banking ecosystem has gone beyond providing simple online banking functions and now traverses capital markets, asset management, insurance brokerage, and advisory. Its purpose is not merely to replicate the function of a bank branch. Virtual banking can offer new services and reach new customers, for example, those who can’t access conventional banking systems or younger consumers who are less inclined to visit branches. In response, the retail banking terrain now needs to create new experiences for customers, e.g. visualization of portfolio performance on smart tablets and offering a space for meetings between clients and remote customer services representatives.

 

The rationale behind the ascension and expansion of virtual banking is clear. It occupies online rather than physical real estate, paramount in a region and an age where internet and mobile phone penetration is on a rapid rise – resulting in considerable overhead reductions for retail banks. The recent closing of 200 branches by a leading commercial bank in Thailand, in its push for greater digitalization, supports our understanding that this is happening. As simple, routine transactions shift to online platforms, staffing costs can also be reduced. But, the role of the conventional teller has now grown into a crucial element in banking operations. These employees have a greater role to play as a brand advocate through their face-to-face interactions and the assistance they provide at self-service stations.

 

VIRTUAL BANKING IN ASIA PACIFIC

 

The catalytic nature of virtual banking is perhaps most pronounced in China, where “pure online banks” are filling gaps in the market. Backed by Alibaba Group, “MYBank” targets smaller enterprises and the rural market, which is indicative of how virtual banking can bring new market participants into this new era of banking. Additionally, through virtual banking operators’ ability to determine credit worthiness through user generated data, customer predictions and analyses can be conducted to detect fraud, allowing for responsible, inexpensive and time-efficient micro-lending. Micro-lending is only a start. When usage increases, more data for projections materializes and cross-selling opportunities for credit cards, insurance and other products can arise.

 

Elsewhere in South Korea, two virtual banks arrived on the scene in 2015 - Kaokao bank and K bank. Figures released by the local regulator reveal that the two players combined attracted over seven million new customers and provided an estimated USD 7.5 billion in loan financing within their first year of operations. This underpins the virtual banking system’s ability to broaden the entire banking landscape. A similar story is unfolding this year in Hong Kong, where the local monetary authority has granted eight virtual banking licenses as part of a wider governmental push to instill greater financial innovation in the economy.

 

ROOM FOR TWO

 

A new retail banking environment has been cultivated as a result of the competition from virtual banking.  On one hand, it offers flexibility, time savings and a differentiated customer experience. However, virtual banking is not a replacement for retail banking. Foreseeable hinderances to its seamlessness are its potential difficulties in absorbing deposits which will increase cost funding, regulatory requirements and cybersecurity threats. Given that virtual and traditional banking are not mutually exclusive, it is worthwhile for banks to first understand the nuances in each market (certain markets may be more vulnerable to the rise of online channels) and subsequently create a mixture of different bank formats.

 

Despite the increasing prominence of virtual banking and its growing level of sophistication, traditional retail banks will remain a staple in the equation of banking operations. To compete with virtual banking, the success of retail banking operators in the coming years will hinge on their ability to rethink their interior spaces and design an optimal layout depending on the local market. This means that the purpose of flagship, standard, self-service and pop-up formats need to be tactfully engineered to the needs and desires of local catchments.

 

There remain areas in which virtual banking is no substitute for traditional banking. The importance of professional, personalized advice for more complex transactions surrounding mortgages and wealth management cannot be negated. What this region will likely see is the emergence of a complementary relationship between traditional and virtual banking – with virtual banking catering to small businesses and the tech-savvy youth, while traditional banking continues to serve corporates, high-net-worth individuals and the mass market.
